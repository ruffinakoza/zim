With the fall of Midgaard, and Rulers being unable to prosecute the crimes

To this end it appears theives, vampires and ninja can often get their first
knockout in as per usual, but might find it a little harder to tag their
victim a second time within a short span of time.  This is due to the
paranoia the victim feels after they wake.  Unfortunately, nobody can keep

clairvoyance - allows you to commune with the creatures of the forest
and ask them if there is anyone poking their head around.  You will only
see those visible to the naked eye.  All others will show up as Someone.
And you'll have to go and look for yourself to find out who it is.
 
pollen - this is your "get out a my forest" skill.  It has no PK restrictions
 It asks the trees to summon pollen to aggrivate your target.  That person
will be plagued with allergies.  Every turn they have a chance of going
blind from their eyes swelling shut.  And every turn they have a chance
of recovering.  They also have a small chance of falling asleep because
of the pollen, and will most likely wake in a turn.  Also, while covered
in pollen they will find it impossible to concele themselves in any 
natural way because of all the itching.
All these affects will stop once they leave the forest.  Should they return
the affects witll start up again.

Text
Aedar and his fellows at the healer guild have just come out of a 
congress centered around the debate on whether to ask the gods' permission
for their healing power, or continue to pilfer it by casting magical spells
that seem similar to the divine blessings.
 
   While all have agree to ask the gods' permission and assistance in the
healing arts, not all members have been so bold as to take up the Barbarian
beliefs.

Subject Clan Politics~
Text
As the clans have grown so have the political turbulation inside them.
No long is having a Leader and a fews Seconds enough to really satisfy the
aspirations of the commoners.  So the buericrats of the realm have offered
a new structure to the clans.
 
   Clans now have a 13 tiered internal ranking system.  If you are in a
clan you will find your list of title you may earn in the clan library
under "titles" {D(type: clantitles){x.
 
   Clan members posessing the rank {yMagistrate{x and above may induct
new members.
 
   Clan members of {yMagistrate{x and above may also promote other members
up to, but not including, their rank.
 
    Clan members may now be promoted, even if they are traveling through
the astral plane {D(not online){x.
 
   There are two ranks below {yRecruit{x (the rank of induction).  They are
{RProbation{x and {rOutcast{x.  If you have not performed your duties as
a clan member well, you may find yourself demoted to these ranks.  At that
time you will also find that your clan skills and powers are no longer
accessible to you.
 
   Finally, Clan members will also be able to easily identify the ranks
of fellow clannies {D(the Who list displays the rank){x for those 
members not yet a Hero.
 
   Oh, and one more thing.  The buericrats frown on, and stricktly forbid
the idea of more than one {BLeader{x of a clan.  After all:
   {WThere can be only ONE!{x

Subject Clan Titles!~
Text
Addendum:
   The buericrats have also determined that clans don't necessarily like
the generic titles for members that the beuricrats have given them.  Thus,
they have made them customizable, and the clan Leader can submit to the 
gods a list of titles (male and female) for their members to hold.
 
On a graver note:
   Those who used to be clan "seconds" will find themselves recruits once
again, and the Leader must promote you to an appropriate rank at their
convinience.

   Thieves have will also experience a better success rate at hiding in the
cities, and a harder time hiding in the broken shadows of the forest.
 
   Also a reminder to all the Hiders out there.  Spamming HIDE will not 
not improve your hide success rate.  If you fail to hide you become visible

to increase their success rate.

Due to the increased amount of clan hopping, it has become apparent that
a few requirements need to be formalized about the process.
 
Here are those requirements:
 
1. All changes of clan must be roleplayed.
 
2. A note to your old clan must be written in a roleplay manner, declaring
your reasons and stating your intentions and disposition toward the old
clan.
 
3. There is a {RONE WEEK{x waiting period once you leave the old clan and
are able to enter the new clan.  This {RMUST{x be a week of active play.
You cannot disappear for the week and then re-emerge to join the new
clan.  Anyone caught doing this risks being denied access to any clan,
or having the waiting period doubled, starting the date of re-emergence.
 
The reason for this last rule it to give your old clan a chance to hunt
those who commit treason, or reject their values, yet carry their secrets
to another clan.  Jumping clans should be a risky endevor.

of stalkers chasing someone is saved when they log.  The next Ruler to

formated for color.
   The area list is color coded.  And all {{R colors should be removed

   "transfer player" now puts them back in the old room after you transfer

   The Build Points that are show in "edit obj" are not accurate yet.  A

Subject {renslavement{x~
Text
Scion,
   The way enslavement works has been changed.  Done away with is the
need for your future slave to "submit" to you.  It just wasn't working
as nobody seemed to want to be a slave . . . go figure.
 
   So now you have a toggle "autoenslave".  If it is on, the next person
you slay in combat will become your slave instead of dying. (thus they will
not suffer CON/exp loss).  Instead they will be stunned for 1 turn
(sometimes this can seem like a long time, sometimes not).  All their
belongings will be cast to the ground for you to loot.
 
   The only way for them to get free is if the slave owner releases them
with "enslave player".  Or if you die while they are around.  Just 
typing "enslave" will show you the current slaves in the world and who
owns them.
 
   It is going to be considered valid RP for slaves to suicide in private
to free themselves.  At that point they will suffer the usual penalties of
death (which were spared them by enslavement).
 
   Also, just so you know, you get PK credit for enslavement.  But you do
not get a PK credit for killing them soon after you enslaved them.
 
   Also, since they do not turn into a ghost at death.  Nor do they get
transported elsewhere, if you spam some area attach you will kill your
slave right after enslavement (which would basically have the same net
effect of just killing them).
 
   Please report if there are any problems with all this.  I'm sure it
will need some tweeking.

Subject Build Points~
Text
Imms,
   I've added an build point calculator to the object editor.  It will
show you how many BPs you're spending when you add stuff to your objects.
The color indicator tells you 'grey' for 0.  '{ybrown{x' for less than 1/3
of your allowed BPs.  '{Ggreen{x' for less than 2/3.  '{Yyellow{x' for
more than 2/3s.  And '{rred{x' if you've exceeded your max.
 
build point calculation is kinda complicated, but read "help bp".  Also
if you add negative things to your item you get more BPs to spend, but
the ratio is not 1:1 for positive and negative effects.
 
The BP calculator hasn't really been solidified yet, so don't take it as
bible.  But you can use it as a guide for now.
 
Also, when you do "alist obj" for your area, you can see the vnums color
coded for quick reference.  If you see a {B[{x before the vnum, then the
item is "rare" (limited) and the BP Max is adjusted for it -- so the
color code should still apply.
 
Also, the average BPs per item for your area is shown.  This should be
a {Ggreen{x number!
 
I'll let you know when the BP calculator is certified bible. {Y:){x
 
Hopefully this will help us build better balanced areas.

Subject Spellbane fixed~
Text
Barbarians,
   Well, I found out on Monday (when I got back from break) that spellbane
was broken.  I looked into it today and found it was completely _missing_
from the code.  Not sure why.  It was actually sucking up spells half the
time, but not saying anything about it.
 
Anyway, fixed it today.  It works a little differently than before.
It deflects spells based on your skill at it, + the difference level
between you and the caster.  And the minus a little if you are asleep.
 
It only does nominal damnage to the caster (mostly for RP effect).
 
If you trigger your own spellbane it will do much more damage.
 
Sorry you didn't talk to Tannice today, Ruan.  You would have known it
was fixed per next reboot.
 
Oh, and when you say "Barbarian is Broken" please specify that a skill
doesn't work.  Saying the clan is broken means something different.  All
wish you would have told me spellbane was broken earlier.

   By popular demand we're bringing back {YLimited{x items.  There won't
be any perm-sanc, or other nut-so, items.  But they will be a lot more
powerful than their normal item counterparts.
 
One of the problems we had before was people using "mule" characters to
horde items.  These were lowbie characters that only held onto items for
other characters a user played.  We're trying to prevent that by not
allowing you to quit with a limited that is not between -15 and +16 your
current level.
 
Many of the items out there now are limited {Y400{x.  This will gradually
be changed, as the builders go through their areas.
 
If you are one of those people who has a character that just check notes
once a month, please be kind and do not hang onto any limited items.  It
will just deprive the rest of the people from enjoying that aspect of
the game.

okay, peeps,
 
Many of the ole timers here are still pining for the good ole days when
there was no MultiKill rule, and you could just beat each other senseless
for hours on end without troubling yourself over creating a new RP reason.
 
In that vein, we timidly bring you the {rmultikiller{x toggle.  Well, not
really a toggle, because you {rCANNOT{c turn it {rOFF{x.  Once you set
the Multikiller flag, it is set for life.  Don't even try to ask the 
immortals to remove your flag.  Impossible.
 
So, what does activating the MultiKiller flag get you?  Well, it means that
any {rtwo{x people who {rboth{x have the multikiller flag set can ignore
the Multikill rule with each other.  They can kill each other until CON
deletion, if they want -- all in one day, if they're really head strong.
 
So, here are the rules (just to be clear):
 
If you are a {rmultikiller{x and your victim is not, you {RMUST{x abide by
the {CMULTIKILL{x rules.

If you are {rnot{x a multikiller, and your victim is a {rmultikiller{x you
{RMUST{x abide by the {CMULTIKILL{x rules.
But!

If you are a {rmultikiller{x and your victim is a {rmultikiller{x then you
can {RIGNORE{x the {CMULTIKILL{x rules and just keep slaying each other.
(though it would be nice if you gave the other guy a chance to equip or
something, but don't expect him to give you that honor).
 
You will be able to tell a fellow {rmultikiller{x because their {DPK{x flag
will be {Dblack{x instead of {Rred{x.
 
This feature is brought to you with great trepedation, and if it doesn't
work out, then it will prolly vanish.  But for now, enjoy.

Subject Samurai Dishonor~
Text
In the last month or so it has become common practice to engage a
Samurai in combat with your pet, then flee and nofollow your pet, thus
binding the Samurai's honor to the death of the pet, while you ranged him
from the next room.
 
Obviously, no true samurai would stick around to be pelted from afar while
he tangoed with some pet.
 
Thus, we've changed the Samurai's obligation to fight unto-death.  (which
honestly, is unfortunate, but some people just won't stop exploiting bugs).
 
So, what we've come up with is this:
 
When a samurai dishonors there are two cases -
   a) he dishonors against overwhelming odds
      For this case he will flee as normal, and will not suffer any
      penalty other than the normal flee penalty.
   b) He flees against even or lesser odds.
      If this is the case, then the samurai will suffer "dishonor"
      in the way of -2 level affect, and -3 charisma.
      He will also lose 1-2k of exp (depending on level).
      {DConsider that before this change, he couldn't flee in this senario
      and would have died, losing 2/3 exp and a death.{x
      He will not be able to gain exp from battle until he regains his
      honor.  To do so he must fight a peer in battle, or an NPC who
      is considered {Gpunk{x to him or higher.
 
It's not a perfect solution, but we think it still preserves the difficulty
of being a samurai, while eliminating the certain death of the bug mentioned
above.

Some of you may notice some changes in the quest gear.  Mostly this is a

All this is in preparation for a new flurry of changes that will make
Move almost as important for people as Mana is for casting classes.  As
many of you know we're also making stats more significant.  And to do that
we've had to change the modifiers on the quest gear, as well as some

races, classes and people, we need for them to be harder to get.
 
It might be a bit before we have the Vault updated.

{Mquest return LostItem{x to get the {Ycost{x in {mquest points{x from Questus.
 
{RPLEASE{x, take note of how many people are in the realm and the likelyhood
of someone finding all the quest items and turning them in.  Also keep
an eye on alt-dropping.
 
Good idea to make the objects quit-rot, and drop-rot, or something.
 
Also, you can only set a cost of 30 or less.  Any more and you will have
to individually re-imburse the player.  This is to prevent any kinda of
accidents that would flood the market with quest points.
 
Remember, as it stands quest points are the {BONE{x thing that is really
non-transferable in this game.  Let's keep it that way.
 
Also, currentl "quest" items can still be found by Shadow clan with one
of their skills.  I'm considering making this impossible in the near
future.

Subject Making Movement matter ++~
Text
In our upcoming series, making stats matter, we're also making Movement
points matter.  Diffent actions will begin to cost more Move in the near
future.
 
Moving while Hiding, and Camoflagued will now cost you movements.
Hiding and Camo will be altered by dex.
 
Moving while Imp_invis and Invis will cost you mana.  These will be 
adjusted by Wisdom (the more wisdom the more efficient you are -- don't
want to lopside mages with only INT to matter).
 
We're experiementing with the values, so if they seem rediculous they might
change.  But the idea is to make it so hider/imp_invisers need to choose
when they want to be hidden and when they want to be visible -- instead of
being immune to people who can't see them all the time.

Text
Okay, a few interesting changes coming up:
 
1) summon, and Who-PK bugs are squashed.
 
2) Containers and magic items like wands, staves, potion, pills and scrolls
are going to work a little differently.  If you want to put them in a 
container, you'll need to find a appropriate container for them.  They will
just get jumbled up and destroyed in normal bags.
 
We will be placing these special container in shops around the realm.
 
This change is mostly to fix the problem of people walking around wiht
several hundred pills and potions -- which tend to nullifiy their class's
lack of casting ability.
 
3) Encumberance can no be seen on your score sheet and in your prompt (%c).
Soon this will affect dexterity based skills and movement.  The more 
saddled down you are, the harder it is to dodge and such.
 
4) Shield Block will now be affected by STR difference.  It will also
be affected by Giant Strength.
 
5) Parry will be affected by both STR diff and DEX diff.  It will also
be affected by Giant Strength.
 
6) flee and escape now have lag added to them.

okay-dokie, more small changes,
 
The big one is this
 
{D- {Wencumberance{x : now affects movement.  The more encumbered you are
   over 35%, the more difficult it is to move.
 
{D- {Wencumberance{x : also affects 'dodge'.  If you are under 15% weight
   you will get a small bonus to dodge.  If you are over 35% you will get
   a penalty.  I imagine a non-giant/orc trying to get under 15% will be 
   near impossible if not naked.  And keeping under 35% might be hard too.
   It's supposed to be that way.  In the near future we will be going over
   the weights of all items, so don't be surprised if they change.
 
{D- {Wshops{x : you can now buy any item you can wear.  No longer will you
   need someone bigger to buy that glorious Sentua gear. {Y:){x
 
{D- {Wstealing{x : you can no longer steal coins from shopkeepers, only items.
 
{D- {Wsage{x : the sage will now charge you according to your level to identify
   items.  Items that are "rare" or "limited" are much more expensive.  These
   prices will seem high, but then consider the value of money today.
 
{D- {Whealer {x: the healer will also charge you based on your level.  Those
   under level 10 will receive a discount.
 
{D- {Wlooting{x : if you are under lvl 20, you can only loot corpses in your
   PK range.  No more lvl 2's, who are immune to PK, looting heros.
 
{D- {Wdonation pit{x : you can now only "get all pit" from the donation pit of
   your recall.  Otherwise you'll be asked not to be greedy.  People who are
   neutral and recall to Midgaard will obviously be at a slight advantage.  But
   then those people are often newbies.
 
{D- {Wclimate{x : it no longer rains in the desert, nor in the arctic.
 
{D- {Wroads{x : a new room sector called "Road" will be used to ease movement
   tax when you are on it.

Okay, a few changes occured.  I might miss a few in this change report as
I made a few of them a week ago and forgot to write them down.
 
{BMajor Change:{x
{W- {Gchannels{x : the public channel code was completely re-written from

changes at first, but wait, there's more!  You can add {gadverbs{x to your
public {WIn Character{x channels' emotes.  So for example you might see
the text:
   Zsuzsu gossips candidly, '{RI hope this works!{x{x{z'

   {Bgossip candidly "I hope this works!
{xThe quote character(") is used to delimit the division between your adverb
and what you want to say.  So, please be careful when using the (") character
in your normal text.
 
{W- {Gchannels DISABLED{x : channels can now be disabled at the whim of IMMs.
Lately a LOT of OOC conversations could really be good IC conversations with
just a little bit of thought.  If an IMM sees one of these conversations 
going on they might turn off the OOC channel to give you the hint to take
it to the gossip channel.  If you resort to bringing the conversation to 
the {Mnewbie{x channel, you will be punished.
 
{W- {GD&D{x : the D&D text at the top of the Who list will reflect the average
alignment of the realm.  Immortal will not be counted.  I just thought it
might be fun to be a paladin and enter the realm with an overwhelmingly
evil feeling about it. {Y:){x
 
{W- {Granger staff{x : now commune, instead of cast spells on their wielders.
 
{W- {Gconjured weapons{x : no longer have insane hit/dam rolls.  Certain
weapons were conjured to be almost as strong as a {WKatana{x, and that's
not at all what we want.  They will still have superior hit/dam to quest
weapons at hero.
 
{W- {Gvanish{x : vanish should no longer work in guildhalls.  Please report

Subject Channels + Silence~
Text
Imms,
   As you can see I re-wrote the channels.  I'm in the process of changing
'pray' to 'immhelp'.
 
   We now have the ability to turn on and off global channels, as well as
silence someone on a channel.  The command is '{Dsilence{x', look at the
helpfile for reference.  Please use discresion in turning on and off all
channels but OOC.  For that, as soon as there's a conversation that should
really be IC go ahead and turn it off for a few minutes so the morts get
the hint.
 
Also, there is a new WIZNET called "ANNOUNCE".  It's for generic announce-
ment notification, like when someone silences the global channel, or turns
the world into an arena.
 
Oh, and since the new help is going to be called "immhelp" with also the 
alias "wizhelp" (which is a common name on some muds for this function), I
have renamed our "wizhelp" to "wizcom", short for "wizcommands".

Text
okay peeps,
 
   As many of you have realized the {GGR{x on the who-list stands for
{GGroup Range{x.  This allows you to figure out who you should pester for
grouping to kill fidos, or whatever.
 
   The {mpray{x command has always bothered me.  Many new players assume
that this is a way to pray the gods for help, rather than a way to communicate
with the immortal staff in an OOC fashion.  Thus, the old {Wpray{x command
is now called {Wimmhelp{x.
 
   The new {MPray{x command does more of what you might RP expect.  While
it doesn't yet talk to your god, it does communicate with the rest of 
the followers of that god -- much like a clan.  Maybe the cool thing will
be that this will promote more unity in religions.  And no, just because
a Paladin and a Vampire worship the same god it does not mean they can
even tolerate each other . . . there are far too many examples of this
in the world to point out here.
 
   This is our first step into making religions more important in the realm.
 
   And I'll take this time to remind you that you can lookup who worships your
god by issuing the command '{Bwho tattoo{x'.

   Also, {MFaerie Fire{x now makes people incapable of going invisible
and even improved invisibile.

Text
Okay folks a few changes:
 
{W- {Gdishonor{x - the penalities for dishonoring just got stiffer.  You can no-
        longer quest, nor form or join a new group while you are dishonored.
        You cannot practice, nor can you skills improve.  Also, if you have
        the Goktengri tattoo it will sting you instead of giving you an extra
        attack.

{W- {Gkatana{x - is now a weapon type, instead of a "longsword".  Only warriors and
        samurai will get this skill.  Warriors will get a severe skill penality
        for using it (basically they can't go above 50% skill in it).
        The skill to create a katana is now called "make katana".

{W- {Gvampiric{x - has been fixed and should now be a desirable weapon flag.  It
        sucks about +20% damage per hit, and the wielder receives half of
        that to their HPs.
{W- {Gknife{x - the thief "knife" skill is once again a "finishing blow" skill.  It
        only works when the person has less than 20% of their HPs.  Backstab
        works for HPs above 60%.

{W- {Glights{x - identifying a light will tell you the percentage of fuel left in
        the light.  When a light goes out (for any reason) it will not
        disappear.  Instead, you'll be able to recharge it with the
        "continual light".  The higher your level, the more you'll recharge.

{W- {Gpoison{x - can only take you down to 2/3 your natural STR now.  Any more,
        along with encumberance was locking people in place with their
        burden.  It will still happen, but now only if they are heavily
        encumbered to begin with.

{W- {Gambush{x - now does more damage to NPCs than to PCs.

{W- {Gescape{x - is now only half as successful if you are blind.

{W- {Gweapons{x - the average damage for all weapons is being adjusted so smaller
        weapons will do less damage than things like bastardswords.  There
        are also battle modifiers for each of the weapons.  A polearm is easy
        to tumble against, easier to parry, hard to handblock, and easier to

        A shortsword increases your ability to parry, and so on.  A full

        who should be thanked for the change, modifies the helpfile).{x

{W- {Glance{x - if you are not mounted you will do very little damage.

{W- {Gbow{x - does little damage in melee.  However, the bow's stats are now
        considered in determining the accuracy of your shot, and the damage
        of the arrow. (surprisingly this wasn't the case before).

{YDRUMROLL{x

{W- {Gquestus{x - now has a slew of new weapons!  Every weapon is now available for
        all classes except samurai.  The stats on the weapons are {RNOT{x
        equal.  Some are prolly better than others.  Battle modifiers for
        the weapons should be considered when choosing a quest weapon.

        You can only purchase one weapon.  If you do not like the weapon you
        have you may return it (quest return itemname) for half the original
        cost.

        There are two daggers.  One is for thieves, the other for mages.  For
        a limited time, any Thief with an old dagger may turn theirs in for
        the new Stilleto.

        The weapon flags will now be dependent on your alignment.  If you
        are {CGood{x you will get a Holy weapon.  If you are {bNeu{gtral{x you will
        still get a Flaming weapon.  And if you are {rEvil{x you will get a
        Vampiric weapon.

        Quest weapons will have better average damage than most other weapons
        in the game.  Limiteds and some Rares will still be stronger.

        It will take some time for us to update the Vault.  To see the stats
        on the new Quest weapons, please refer to the forum's "Changes"
        section. {Yhttp://dnd-olc.e-boxen.com/forums{x

{RNOTE:{x your old quest items may get a little funky.  If that is the case
        you may ask an immortal to eat it for you, so you can quest trouble
        for one of the new weapons.
{RNOTE{r2{R: the values of these quest items are subject to change in the next
        week or so, if we need to tweek them.  If this kinda thing upsets you
        I suggest you hold off buy a new weapon for a week or two, at least.

Text
{WThe White Star Inn is now open for business!  Located to the east of
Temple Square, the inn offers a cozy setting for local folk and adventurers
alike to gather together and have a few drinks.  Fine rooms are available
for those with the gold to pay, offering a warm place to rest and recuperate
from your travels.  All are invited come share their stories over a fine mug
of ale.  
 
{c(OOC: There are several things you'll all need to know about this new inn.
The first is that the common room is made up of safe and peace rooms. What
this means is that players cannot pk each other there, nor steal from each
other. You can however still die of starvation, poison, illness, etc., and
corpses CAN be looted there if you die in such a way. In addition, those
who are {RWANTED{c are not safe from stalkers or bodyguards there. The
inn is not entirely safe, so be careful. The rooms that can be rented
upstairs are NOT safe. {CThe healing rate inside the safe rooms is set at
0, so you will not be able to recuperate your hp or mana while there.{c
 
Those renting the best rooms upstairs will benefit from the maids' gossip
that will announce the name of whoever walks past them in the hallway. Those
who don't want their presence known can attempt to bribe the maid, so that
she will let them pass and keep quiet.
 
{cThe safe rooms are an experiment, and depending on the reaction we receive, 
we may or may not keep them.
 
{CIf you notice any bugs, please send a note to me (nalaeya) and I'll fix
them as soon as possible. Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated,
please post them on the forums.{x

Okay folks,
 
   Blessed weapons will now receive a +toHit instead of -AC.
 
   Cursed weapons will now receive a -toHit.  And armor will receive a
+AC (that is, it will be worse).  This should be fun for the evil amongst
you to curse someone's gear (after PK or disarming or whatever) and give
it back to them. {r:){x
 
   Other things fixed: Ranger staff bug, Mastering sword bug, and the newbie
infinite battle with the beetle.  Old katana will now turn into a katana
automagically.
 
   Also, holy weapons now ALWAYS inflict holy damage, but do less of a 
percentage (same net total, just works a little differently).
 
   Vampiric weapons will now only boost you to 120% your normal HPs, instead
of infinitely (which was the case today o.O).  
 
   And the exp gain for skills is now variable, and MUCH lower.   Since it
is silly to gain more exp from spamming "hide hide hide hide" than going
out and killing something.
 
Okay, I think that's it for this time around.

Okay,
 
   In the interest of giving everyone a fair shake, we're going to try
something a little different for this month, and maybe keep it for a 
while, just to see how well it does.
 
Since people have been complaining about each others' clans, saying X clan
is way too powerful, or Y clan is invincible, we're going to switch things
up a little.
 
The other thing is people have been complaining that unclanned people are
getting the raw end of the stick since they have no ueber powers.
 
So this is what we're going to do:
 
{GAfter the next reboot:{x
 
   {Y- {xBarbarian and Warlock are going to swap abilities, so that they 
each find out what it's like to be the other.
   {Y- {xSentinel abilities are given to Knight, and Knight abilities are
going to be given to Scion.  Sure, it will look a little odd, with a Scion
vampire riding around on a horse, but this is just for a while so they can
see that Knight's aren't that ueber.
   {Y-{x Sylvan abilities are going to be given to Shadow and vice-versa,
since Shadow has long bemoaned not having a PK skill.  And Sylvan, should
really have certain abilities of Shadow, as it would make sense.
   {Y-{x And finally, Scion abilities are going to be given to all unclanned
players over the rank of 40.  That way the unclanned will stand a chance
against the clanned players.  Hopefully this will promote a little more
empathy in some of the clans for those who formerly had no home.
 
Remember, we're just trying this out.  We'll see how it goes.

A while ago, Thorel enacted a rule that essentially said no clanmember can ever
use his or her clan's skills to aid someone outside of the clan.
 
After some discussion, Nalaeya and I have decided to declare the afforementioned
rule dead.
 
Essentially, if a clan member wants to aid a comrade outside his or her clan
with their unique skills, this is A-OK, as long as it's RP-appropriate. To
maintain some level of secrecy, however, explaining a clanskill's name, use
and purpose in full detail is still a no-no. However, simply saying "My clan
has a skill that can help us" or something similar while using it is acceptable.
 
Clan leaders can put further restrictions on the use of their skills, at their
own descretion.
 
I encourage all clan leaders to post a note to their clans clarifying when and
how their skills can be used outside of their clan.

Text
Okay folks,
 
   Due to an anticipated change in the quest system, where we will 
institute a progressive quest point reward system, you can expect
significant QP inflation in the next week or so.
 
   This change is mostly going to be problematic for Heros.  Since QPs
will be easier to earn at Hero, the costs of certain things will rise
purportionaly.  The number of quest completes needed to purchase items
will remain relatively the same for certain items (sam deaths, rugs, money,
etc) but your existing QPs will lose purchasing power (inflation).
 
   Therefore, we recommend you make whatever purchases you're expecting to
make in the next week before the change happens.  If you are planning on
purchasing a house, please declare that ASAP, so you can lock in the
current price with your current QP total.
