Okay, folks,
 
Because of the generous and quick response to the pledge drive, I was able
to get MudMagic.com to host us for a few days while people submit donations.

We have {Y6 days{x to collect thhe {C$120{c US{x necessary to keep this place
going for the next year.  If not, then the Mud goes {Cp{c00{Cf{x for the last
time.  So please goto: {Yhttp://lnl.mudmagic.com/{x and click on {Ydonate{x.
 
Because the old server is totally down and inaccessible there is no way
for me to get the latest pfiles.  We're lucky to have {RANY{x backups
since we can't get to Thornan's server.  Luckily I made nightly backups
to my brother's server -- which is why we have any mud at all!  Unfortunately,
the old server was down at night and so pfiles changed since the {Dtroubles{x
didn't get updated. {Y:/{x
 
Anyway, the forums are up (though you'll need to get a new avatar) and
we're almost set to roll.  Just need the donations.
 
Right now we have {c${C100{x in pledges, and {c${C0{x actually donated, so
please hurry to keep LnL alive!
