The Darknight guardian~
The Darknight guardian is here, halting your intrusion into the castle.
~
You look upon an armor clad man of huge stature, and he lifts his visor
to get a good look at you.  He stands guarding the gate to the castle, and
takes his duty very seriously.  He grunts at you to go away, and cracks his
huge knuckles menacingly.

darknight drow elf darkelf~
a drow knight~
A Drow Darknight is standing rigid here, eyeing you suspiciously.
~
Standing straight before you is a medium sized dark elf clad in black
armor and wielding a tempered steel blade.  His breastplate is unusual, it
is inky black with a golden skull on it and is sparkling brilliantly from a
fresh polishing job.  Upon your entry into his ground, he loosens his sword
in its scabbard, and poises himself for battle.

A Duergar Darknight~
A Duergar Darknight is here, slouching on duty and eyeing you eagerly.
~
A short, stout darknight is here, one of the dark-dwarf race.  His long
beard almost completely covers his tunic, and he pulls a sharp knife from
his legplates and tosses it deftly.  He catches the knife with out even
looking at it, for he has kept his gaze focused on you the whole time.  As
he leans against the stone wall, you notice that his legs are bent, ready to
spring at the slightest sign of danger.

Arakyan~
The great lord Arakyan stands here, glaring impatiently at his officers.
~
A man of immeasurable stature, Arakyan dwarfs his officers.  He has a
commanding air about him, he is a natural leader, an important man.  His
manner is suave and clever, he moves with grace despite his heavy armor and
muscular bulk.  Clothed in fine garments, he is the epitome of richness,
although his embroidered silk tunic is not only of finest cut, but plated
with milky black steel, polished to perfection.  Thick leather boots don't
fit with the rest of his outfit, however they do suit his nature as a leader
of knights.  His scruffy face is as handsome as it is harsh, angular
cheekbones and deepset gray eyes stare back at you from beneath curved
eyebrows.  Long black hair flows down his face, and curls slightly on his
shoulders.  An admirable man, a respectful man, you feel a sudden urge to
kneel down before this giant and submit yourself to his will.

The Dew-covered Forest Trail~
You are standing on a small dew-covered trail in the forest which leads
further into darkness.  Fog clouds around your head, and the leafy boughs
are bent towards into the ground from the weight of the dew.  
 
There is a large map pinned to a tree here, as well as a

As you continue to walk the trail slowly disappears into the thick grass,
and the ground becomes springier.  The trees here are sparser, and you can
see far to the north a grand valley.

Before the Gates of the Castle~
The forest has cleared, giving way to a large valley which is filled up
by an enormous dark castle.  As you stand before its majestic gates, you
feel chilled by its dark presence.  It seems to cast unnatural shadows all
through out the valley, and is overall quite disturbing.

The hidden room of {Dshadows{x~
You are floating in what seems to be pure nothingness.  Looking around
frantically, all you can see is inpenetratable darkness, through which your
eyes can see nothing.  Just as you begin to panic, the vision fades away and
a comfy black chair appears.  How odd....

Inside the Castle Gates~
You have passed through the gates to the castle, and are now just on the
inside of them.  Looking around you see huge walls of stone that are covered
in dark scorch marks and in numerous places large chunks have been sliced
clean out of the wall, and the ceiling must be at least one hundred feet
above your head.  There are many small holes in the wall, holes that look
about the perfect size for an arrow to go through.  You may continue north
into the courtyard or follow the spiral staircase upwards.

A Landing in the Spiral Staircase~
You have arrived at a landing in the large staircase, it seems to be
about halfway up to the top.  On the walls you see many inscriptions, some
protraying evil gods and godesses, and others showing grand battles.  From
here you can go back down to the castle gates, or you can continue upwards
towards the battlements.

The Inner courtyard~
Having journied past the gates, you arrive at the inner courtyard of this
mysterious castle.  It is very quiet, and the carefully watered plants make
no noise as the wind rustles them.  This whole place seems devoid of life,
as if everything knows better than to come near this dread place.  The
courtyard continues to the east and west, and to the north looms a huge
entrance hall.

On the battlements~
You have arrived on the battlements of the castle, and you can see across
the courtyard the main section of the castle, towering so high that its
spires scrape the heavens.  Looking along the stone pathway, you see dark
figures in the distance standing guard on the battlements.  So maybe this
castle is inhabited after all...

Along the battlements~
The battlements continue here, and there seem to be tally marks etched in
the stone, as if someone on guard was playing a game up here.  However,
there are other marks in the stone as well, holes pierced into the thick
wall, cracks that were sliced open, and even an old rusty sword stuck into
the ground.  However, most disturbing is the dark red stain on the floor, it
resembles {Rblood{w that has long ago dried out.  To the west the battlements
round a corner, and you see the sun glint off of steel.

wall here is even more littered with holes and cracks and gore.  A helmet
split open in the middle lies here, as does several fragments of a broken
spear shaft.  To the north and east the battlements continue.

The Foyer of the Castle~
You have entered the magnificent foyer of the castle, a large
dome-ceilinged room made out of thick stone.  Torches burn brightly in their
wall sconces, spreading a yellow light across the room and a smell of burnt
oil.  As the light flickers over the floor, you see an extravagant black rug
that covers the whole floor.  Maybe you should look at the rug a little
closer.  To the north the foyer opens up into an even larger room, the great
hall, and to the south you can return to the inner courtyard.

rug~
Taking a closer look at this huge black rug, you see pictures of evil
deeds and deities.  The rug depicts scenes of grand battles, with mounted
knights clad in shining black armor slicing a path through a small unit of
foot soldiers bearing the insignia of good, and also pictures of an evil
queen sitting atop a throne of living, coiling snakes.

are numerous tapestries and beautiful weapons encased in glass frames.

leading to the east.  It is very quiet here, the only sound being the
occasional gust of wind blowing through cracks in the stones, or the
occasional page hustling through with an urgent message clasped tightly in
one hand.  Looking further up you can see the stairs continue, possibly all
the way until the very top of the tower.

An intersection of hallways~
You have arrived at a busy intersection between two sections of this
hall.  This place is constantly busy, being the only (obvious) way to get
from the hallway back down to the main floor of the castle.  There are much
more torches here, although they are not the main source of light.  The main
source of light seems to come from the south, where occasional bursts of
light flare into the hall, acompanied by the loud clang of hammer on red-hot
steel.  You can enter the military hall to the south or north, or go back
east to the landing.

It is cooler here in the northern end of the hall, and there are no
tapestries or paintings for visitors to look at.  This section of the
hallway is reserved for the lower ranking darknights, as their barracks
surround the room.  Torches are not the only things on the walls here,
however.  Lying stacked in huge rows is a myriad assortment of weapons.  Any
concievable type of weapon is here, be it spear, dagger or axe, and it seems
to be explained by a SIGN planted in the floor.

maps have black flags drawn on them, and some others have large red X's
stamped on them.  There are heavy wooden doors leading west and east, or you
can continue south, or come back north the way you came.

sections that have been severely charred.  Wondering why this has happened,
you see a brilliantly bright forge to the west, where a giant is beating a
piece of metal. To the east you hear gruff orders being yelled
at someone.  Through the open doorway to the south, you can
see a stout dwarf stacking armor on the wall.

Peering around this brightly lit room, you can tell that you are in an
office of a higher ranking darknight.  The floor is very well cleaned, and
not a speck of dust is visible on the polished oak desk, but then again the
desk is not even visible beneath the myriad maps and pens scattered over it.
Pinned to the wall are several shining medals, and a keen-edged knightsword
gleams from its position on top of two rods wedged in the walls.

The {RFiery{W forge{x~
Immediately upon entering this room you are bombarded with a wave of
{Yintense{x {Rheat{x.  Once you readjust to the temperature of this room you
notice several interesting things about it.  First off, the stones are
blackened and almost melting, the first sign of any erosion of the stones
you have seen since entering the castle.  Secondly, you see a huge forge in
the center of the room, where a gargantuan fire giant is rapdidly turning
thick sheets of steel into metal pancakes.  The huge fellow radiates so much
heat that it seems he heats the forge himself!  You also notice that this
room is completely devoid of paintings, since they probably were burned to
ashes the second they were hung up on the wall.  Replacing the paintings are
stack upon stack of cold, hard steel blades, glinting from the glow of the
fire.

counter where the bartering is done, and then behind that are many stone
shelves and cabinets that probably contain tools and metal used to make the
armor.  The most outstanding hand-crafted armor is framed in glass display
cases, the polished, glossy black steel reflects any and every light that
shines on it.

the darknights here do not live in grandeur, nor do they live in poverty. 
The walls here are upkept nicely, and show little wear although the stones
must be ages old.  Pushed along the edge of the room to make space are
several small cots, with unadorned wooden blankets.  On the walls adjacent
to the cots, there have been large chunks taken cleanly out of the wall, and
these serve as tables for the darknights' belongings.  Few torches line the
walls here, and water drips from the ceiling.

The End of the Tunnel~
The tunnel ends here in a thick wooden door at the east, where light
seeps through the crack between the door and the floor.  The stone floor is
damp from the constant dripping of water from the roof above, and a chill
wind penetrates the cracks in the thick stones to chill the room.

A Musty Hall~
Here the tunnel has widened into a dank hallway, where a musty scent
lingers in the chilly air.  A hardwood floor has replaced the crude
stonework, and the peeling gray paint breaks off of the wooden walls to
float gently to the ground.  Only three torches hang from the wall, the
fourth seems to be missing.

You are in the mage hall, where the mages of the tower reside.  The air
here is dank, and smells very strongly of rose petals and burnt flesh.  The
corridor is dimly lit by an unseen source, there are no windows in this

The Unholy Temple~
This room has been remodeled into an extremely evil temple.  Black,
bloodstained pillars hold up the darkened cathedral ceiling, many of the
pillars have chips taken out of them.  The black tile floor is covered with
a soft black carpet, with golden edges.  At the southern end of the room is
an altar glowing darkly, it seems to radiate evil like the rest of the room.

smells, smells from spices, and from sizzling haunches of meat.  Messy

extravagant tapestries or carved wooden torches.  No windows line the walls
here, although you can feel that you are very high up in the tower.

and luxury that overrides the sickly sweet scent of decay.  A plush red
carpet lines the floor, and most of the large stone blocks are covered in
extravagant tapestries or carved wooden torches.  No windows line the walls
here, although you can feel that you are very high up in the tower.

A Turn in the Hallway~
The hallway makes a turn to the east here, taking with it the scents of
the castle, although the scent of death and decay grows stronger.  Some
portions of the velvet carpet have been burnt off, and the edges are frayed
in parts.  Wondering what caused these abnormalities, you see that the hall
continues to the east.

A Hallway Junction~
The two branches of the hallway merge together here, along with the
carpet.  This section of the hall is more elegantly appointed than the rest,
it is a hallway fit for a king.  However, the royal image is marred by some
misplaced torches strewn about the ground, and a huge dent the shape of a
head shoved into the wall.

with steel reinforcements.  There is little light here, only a small pool
shed by a single torch that illumines the door leading to the north.  It

Chamber of Arakyan~
You have entered the grand chamber of Arakyan, leader of the darknights. 
His room is glorious, not one square of the walls is left uncovered, not one
patch of the floor is bare.  Acrid-smelling torches burn brightly in their
cases, lighting up bold tapestries and numerous paintings.  The embroidered
red carpet is one huge tapestry, a giant memory of past battles sewn into
silky velvet.

You have entered a cavernous room, yet its size seems less than it really
is because of the multitude of elegant furniture placed about the room. 
Smooth mahogany desks and chairs and bookcases rest against the walls, and a
large black velvet four-poster bed is centered in the room.  A large window
on the eastern wall leads to a magnificent view of the valley surrounding
the castle, you never realized until now how beautiful the green-topped
trees look, swaying gently in the breeze...

is little grip here.  Looking around yourself, the view is absolutely
amazing.  A dense forest surrounds the dark gray castle, yet the sky is very
dark.  You see another spire far off to the west.

tranquility, however it may not be wise to stay in one place for long here.

besides the weeds, but not much.  It seems many things inhabit this place,
for there are many tracks on the ground.

You are approaching an encampment in the ruins, judging by several poorly

In an Encampment~
You have entered a small encampment, probably where the militia made camp
for the night.  You can see several tents propped up on top of the weeds and
stone blocks, someone made a half-hearted attempt to camouflage them,
judging by the random assortment of leaves and branches on top of the tents.

You are just outside of a very large hut, built of wooden planks.  A
large piece of cloth blocks the entranceway to the hut, and you notice that
the roof is shaped in an odd way, a small horn curves upwards at every
corner.  Painted on the front of the hut is a picture of a very large
centaur brandishing a bow.

A Small Dwarven Cottage~
You have entered a solitary dwarven cottage, it is quite small and made
of sturdy logs.  There are no windows in the house, the only light comes
from some dying embers in a small forge that looks as though it has not been
used in quite some time.  The floor is covered in festive mats and rugs, and
there are some well-crafted tables and a poofy leather armchair.

from hooks all over the walls, meats of any kind imaginable.  Near the west
wall of the room are several enormous barrels, most likely holding smoked
meat.
