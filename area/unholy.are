evil monk~
an evil monk~

a clay golem~
A statue fashioned from clay stands motionless here.
~
This statue isn't very well-fashioned, and isn't very attractive. You wonder
why even the unholy monks would use such art in their abbey. Shrug.

monk master~
a master~
A monk clad in black robes with silver edging sneers contemptously at you.
~
The master monks are the teachers and supervisors of the monks of the abbey,
and answer only to the abbot himself. They are if anything more diabolical
than their demented pupils, and twice as deadly.

necromancer~
a necromancer~
A frail old man clad in purple robes casts evil incantations here.
~
The abbey employs several necromancers to create their legions of undead,
with which they one day intend to conquer the kingdom of Malathar. They are
horrid, twisted, decrepit old men, who have incredible magical powers.

abbot~
the abbot~
The unholy abbot screams vile curses at you and attacks!
~
The abbot is a vile, despicable old tyrant who rules his damned abbey with
an iron fist and a lust for conquest and death bordering on the maniacal.
He may be a shrivelled old man, but he is still immensely powerful.

wight~
a wight~
A leering wight leaps to attack you.
~
The necromancers of the abbey have animated the remains of Knights of
Malathar slain by the monks and transformed them into horrid wights, and
additionally infusing them with a manic desire to slay everyone they behold.

A devil that seems to be naught but bones and gristle leers at you.
~
The monks frequently summon devils to aid them in their evil schemes, and
their favorite is the bone devil, who only demands seven virgins rather than
the many scores other devils demand.

an elven virgin~
A scraming, naked young elven maiden is chained to the altar.
~
The monks capture and sacrifice female elven virgins to summon devils from
the Hells. This one has gone quite insane from the pain and shock of capture
and subsequent subjection to the cruel rituals of the monks.

their abbey.

A huge, scarred ogre cracks his whip at you and orders to to surrender.

This overconfident brute is one of many employed by the monks to keep their

The Path to the Craggy Tor~
You are ascending steadily upwards through rough terrain towards a large,
jagged mountain far to the north. There is a small rock resting here, near
the path, which could serve as a passable chair. There is a sign nailed to
a dead tree that hangs over the rock.

sign~
A sign reads:
 
     North lies the Unholy Abbey.  Explorers beware, this is a high level area.
        You are advised to travel in groups for safety.

The Path to the Craggy Tor~
You continue up the path, only vaguely noticing the bleak terrain around
you as the climb is quite exerting. Birds circle far overhead, taking only
a casual interest in you. The path bends sharply to the east at this point.

The Path to the Craggy Tor~
The path bends back to the north here, heading straight for the base of the
Tor. However, there appears to be a deep chasm dividing the path from the
base, and you wonder how you will pass it.

The Edge of the Chasm~
You are heading round the edge of the chasm. You can see no way across it
from here, though you could perhaps proceed across or down if you could
fly. You can still see the Tor, and the abbey at its summit. The black
shape is still hovering atop it.

The Edge of the Chasm~
You reach the edge of the chasm, and stare across at the Tor. Sure enough,
you can see the abbey, nestled in a small crack that divides the top third
of the tor in two. It appears to have no doors or windows, and you can't
see any way across. You think you can see a black shape nestled atop the
abbey.

Nor is there any sign of life, save the massive black shape you spied earlier
perched atop the roof.

You have found the source of the dread howling- a giant bellows, being slowly
worked by a bone golem. It seems a rather puerile protective measure,
considering most intelligent adventurers wouldn't be fooled. YOU weren't
fooled, were you?

A greenish glow is coming from the north.

This is apparently the study of one of the master monks. Bookcases full of

This pit isn't particularly deep, and you hit the bottom wondering what's

sound as your coins start to fall from your money pouch, which is being
eaten away by acid!

The Necromancers' Labs~
You walk into a dank, smelly chamber full of tables stacked with body parts.
Feeble illumination comes from a weak light spell cast on some rods of
mithril; besides that the room is almost completely dark. Doors lead east,
west and north.

This 40'x40' room has the usual two portals, save that here there is no
lock on the one set in the roof. In fact you can walk right into it from
here should you so desire. Hmmm...

Arched hallways run east, south and north, while a door bars passage westward.

you slowly walk along the passage. An eerie feeling comes over you, and you

The Altar~
You have reached the core of the evil, and the wicked heart that pulses the
energy through it. Though you have battled scores of opponents, rarely have
you previously encountered such evil. Foul ichor spews from gashes in the
walls of this place, coalescing into a floating portal to some netherworld
you know naught of. But you soon will, for it is there that you must next
travel, to rid the world of this evil!

live so simply as his followers! You see a bathroom to the east, a study
to the south and a massive bedchamber to the north.
