the anti-paladin guildmaster~
A dark skinned elf is hunched over the table, eyes glowing red.
~
The guildmaster is completely absorbed in the ceremony that he is
performing.  A long flowing hooded cape covers most of his form, the little
of his skin that you can see is dark, almost black.  His red eyes glow with
excitement as he hovers over the corpse, muttering incantations.  You think
it wise to await the completion of his ritual, for disturbing him now could
bring disastrous results.

enter the room.  If you ask him politely, he will probably teach you some
new spellcasting techniques.

A woman of incredible beauty stands here, tears streaming down her cheeks.
~
Dressed in a gown of shimmering blue silk, her dark hair falling in waves
down her back, this woman is perhaps the most beautiful creature you have
ever beheld.  Her dark eyes are a rich brown, contrasting to her fair and
flawless skin.  Her lips and cheeks are red, giving her a flush of life that
looks odd considering the fact that she doesn't seem fully of this world. 
She seems to switch between being solid and translucent, but looks totally
unaware of what is happening.  Her cheeks are stained with tears, and she
weeps miserably, though even red, sore eyes do little to mar her beauty.

Cities {RNOT{x under the jurisdiction of {YR{BU{YL{BE{YR{x.

{WAarakocran City{x - Aarakocran City, the city of Arials, is the
mountain range above {GElemental Canyon{x. For directions to
(and a map of) Elemental Canyon, please purchase the map entitled
"{WThe first steps to Hero{x."
 
{WCity of Anon{x - Considered backwater by many, by virtue of the
inaccessibility, it's rumored there are several ways to get to
Anon.  Vicks and Wedge can help. There's also a path through
the ruins of Old Thalos ("{WThe first steps to Hero{x.")
Please see the local merchants for a detailed map of Anon.
 
{WVillage of Anon{x - From the Temple of Anon, head due west.
 
{WOlympus{x - From the {Ynorth gate{x of Midgaard, head due {mnorth{x.
Please also see: {COlympus{x
 
{WGnome Village{x - The very same ones who work hard to keep Thera's
young adventurers supplied with maps to Midgaard from their
respective hometowns, Gnome Village lies on the {YEastern Road{x
between {GMidgaard{x and {GNew Thalos{x. Gnome Village is past
the {YCross Roads{x but before {GNew Thalos{x, {msouth{x of {YEastern
directly {meast{x. Watch out for the nastier creatures on the way, or
 
{WDwarven Kingdom{x - In order to get to the mines and village
of the Dwarven Kingdom, one must travel first to the {YCross Roads{x
east of {GM{gS{GM{x. Trudging {mnorth{x will lead you to some {Yhills{x.
{mEast{x of the {Yhills{x lies Dwarven Kingdom.
Please also see: {CDwarven_Kingdom{x.
 
{WSentua{x - A small community through the endless desert. From
the {ylevee{x in {GMidgaard{x, one must traverse the {Yriver{x, going
directly {meast{x. Watch out for the nastier creatures on the way, or
you could end up lost!

Cities under the Jurisdiction of {YR{BU{YL{BE{YR{x.
{WMidgaard{x - Gnomes have made efforts to leave a map fluttering
near the pit where you recall.  If you need directions to {GM{gS{GM{x
from your recall point, that's the first place to look!
Please also see: {CMidgaard{x and {CSouthern_Midgaard{x
 
{WNew Thalos{x - In order to get to New Thalos from Midgaard, simply
head east from {GM{gS{GM{x, and you'll find your way to The Market Square
Square of New Thalos!
Please also see: {CNew_Thalos{x
 
{WFayten Keep{x - You must exit the {YNorth Gate{x of Midgaard, into the
plains. Once you exit the North Gate, Fayten Keep lies {mnorthwest{x.
For a map of Fayten Keep, please find the map merchant in Fayten
Keep.
 
{WCaerlon{x - Also north of Midgaard, you must exit the {YNorth Gate{x
into the plains, and you must follow the {Ypath{x through the {Yplains{x
and {Yhills{x until you find the {Ypath intersection{x. From there,
Caerlon lies due north.  For a map of Caerlon, please find the
local map seller in Caerlon.
 
{WValley of the Titans{x - Unfortunantly, the pathway to the Valley
of Titans is a long, unsafe, arduous journey.  It is best advised
to find a capable guide there.  However, rumor has it there exists
a means to quickly get there. {GArials{x known by {GVicks{x and {GWedge{x
offer a map for aid.

It took a long while for Sun react to and understand the means of his
brother's power, but once he did his wrath was far worse then ever
before. Moon and Sun waged a terrible war that in the end nearly broke
both combatants, but Sun was an independent being and had his own
means of replenishing power. Moon on the other had was a wretched
beast of artificial light stolen from his brother, he could not hope match
Sun's strength. Before the end Sun unleashed a devastating attack that
threw Moon into retreat, back to wounded Earth only to be hit with
Earth's stored power trapping Moon in a cycle of unending circles. That
was of course Sun and Earth's own secret agreement. Anything to
protect life..
 
Moon has laid dormant for long while, in deep sleep that was a side
affect of Earth's unexpected betrayal. Beauty is a cunning thing though,
a primal animal that feeds off all life around it making it stronger.
Moon has not forgotten the tricks taught by dear sister.
~

page3~
One evening deep in a state of self pity Moon began to form a plan that
would prove his power and at the time he desperately need proof. He
began to change his decided course and could be seen during the day by
those who moved across Earth's surface, the likes of which had never
before been witnessed. At the end of his journey he placed himself
directly in front of Sun blocking the powerful rays. Sun's anger was
unmatched and in his rage he began releasing his power like he had
never done before. Moon was scorched by his brother's heat and
retreated quickly back into darker skies. With nothing to block the show
of power Earth's surface was badly burnt and almost all life eradicated,
those that survived were forced to seek sanctuary in deep places and did
not reappear for some time.
 
Sun believed Earth responsible for Moon's bold move and so began his
unrelenting fury that did not stop even when he was weary. In this
Earth's most desperate hour she made a secret alliance with Moon and
began gently reflecting Sun's light toward Moon, allowing him too feed
upon it, corrupt it and make it his own. The plan was Moon would
eventually use his newly gained power to attack and consume Sun,
therefore taking his place as the Nourishment.  When Moon was at last
ready he mirrored the steps that started this battle, when he was
blocking Sun once again he unleashed his own fury and nearly took Sun
out of the sky.

There was Moon the Charmer.  Moon was admired by all who looked
upon him, respected and revered by life. The beauty was only surface
deep though, at his core Moon was a bitter thing, resentful and twisted.
Earth and Sun he knew kept life moving forward and would accomplish
greatness because of the power he lacked. In the end Moon had no
domination over any, all he would ever possess was the admiration and
worship of those that looked upon him. And because of his greed this
would not be enough.
 
The three were siblings but there was no love between them, each
despised the other for their attributes. Sun hated Moon for his beauty,
even though Sun warmed and guided life none would ever look directly
at him and because of this Sun secretly thought himself repulsive. Sun
hated Earth for her pacifism and her ability to hold life, he could never
understand or accept her power and caring spirit. Earth hated Moon for
the respect her children gave him, never did they thank her for their
accomplishments, never did they stare upon her for hours in awe and
never did they acknowledge her presence. Earth hated Sun for the lack
of control she had over him and the control he had over her, while she
could partially shield herself from him at times he would shine all the
brighter and diminish her protective clouds. And Moon hated them both
for their ability to keep existence alive. It was fragile relationship.

Trapping the Moon
Written by Serion
 
I tell you now the words of Traitor Earth, Unrelenting Sun and Thieving
Moon.  In times before separate races existed there were three defined
beings of creation, unmoving and unparalleled by all and each other.  There
was Sun the Nourishment.  A courier of thriving life and an undeniable
light.  While Sun supported all it touched it was a wild thing untamed and
unpredictable.  Arrogant for the existence that grew beneath him, Sun would
rarely listen to reason and believed his will was the only power worth
obeying.  
 
There was Earth the Cradle. A mother in nature, Earth believed in her
own ways of raising existence and understood while Sun was essential
only her caring touch and balance of creatures could keep life sustained
She was good at what she did, those that she cared for were like her
children and she treated them as such. So many walked upon her, lived
amongst one another, and never understood the devotion being given to
them.

The tree-eant finished off the last of the orcs, while I removed the
arrow from the tree allowing the dead goblin to slump down on the ground.  I
butchered his corpse and with a high pitched whistle I invited several dire
wolves to feast on the meat.  "Thank you young elf," said the tree-eant as
he slowly stumbled towards me.  He then picked me up took me back to the
Figson, in the Virgin Forest.  This adventure opened my eyes to a future
that I could pursue.  I never realised my potential with a bow, I was merely
acting on instinct.  We sat around a campfire listening to old tales that
the tree-eant had to share, while Figson tended his wounds.  His tales
inspired me, and reinforced my motivation to join the Sylvan Ranks.  This
event helped to appreaciate the bond that we rangers share with nature.
 
And that was my story, Avfril. I hope you enjoyed it. If ever you 
in the area, we should share more tales, songs and poems, around a 
nice warm campfire, under the stars.

Peering north I say several goblins hacking at the poor tree-eant, while
orcs held his powerful branches down with rope.  A tall Orc, wielding a
jagged axe, who seemed to be their commander or chieftain, was yelling
commands at them all.  I over heard him mention that they needed wood for
their next siege on Midgaard.  The colossal tree suddenly dropped a long
thin branch in front of me.  I looked up, and in the grain of the wood, it
appeared as though it was smiling at me.  I picked up the branch and using
some sturdy string I had in my quiver, I strung a new bow.  I hid my old
bow, and drawing an arrow fletched by Ranger Figson, I fired the arrow clean
through the skull a goblin, who was just about to strike the tree-eant.  I
managed to fire off 4 more arrows and slay two orcs before I was noticed. 
Slaying those orcs, freed the eant's strongest branches enabling him to bash
the other orcs.  I turned to run as I heard the chieftain scream "Kill that
elf!  Bring me his head!  I need a new water skin!"  I fired off several
more arrows, killing 3 more goblins.  I headed back towards Midgaard, along
the way finding a useful place to spring a trap.  I hid in some bushes just
off the path, and waited.
 
I could hear the clumsy chieftain stumbling closer, when suddently,
THWANG!!  The trap worked like a charm.  Just as I was about to use him as a
pin-cushion, an arrow came soaring towards my head.  I side-stepped the
arrow which then pierced through the orc chieftains thick skull.  I quickly
turned and fired an arrow west straight through the eye socket of a goblin
archer, pinning him to the colossal tree.

Call of the Forests
Written by Grigolas
 
(Winner of a contest for the best stories of the realm set up by 
the world famous author, Afvril Galhtin)
 
 
After hearing another interesting tale, Avfril Galhtin stood up from his
comfortable chair and wandered over to the bar.  Just as he peered into his
little brown moneypouch to purchase another pint of mead, a gust of wind
blew the door open.  Shortly after a snowy white owl glided through the
doorway and over to the bar where he stood, and door open.  Shortly after a
snowy white owl glided through the doorway and over to the bar where he
stood, and dropped a scroll on the bar.  Intrigued, Avfril patted the owl on
the head and proceeded to roll out the scroll.  As he began to read it, the
owl flew off back out the door, while another mysterious gust of wind blew
the door closed. Avfril scratched his head, baffled, but then continued to
read the parchment. It reads:
 
'Greetings Avfril Galthin.  I am Grigolas Gromwyn, an elven ranger and a
Sylvan warden of the Forests of Thera.  I apologise for not showing up in
person, but there have been many poachers entering the woods of late, and so
I must stay on patrol.  I wish to enlighten you on how I came to be, if you
would hear it.  I was born and raised by the elven rangers of the Virgin
Forest.  While at first I was unsure as to my true path in life, It was on
one fine day that my decision to protect the forest came about.  A cousin
informed me of a note left on the colossal tree by Berkut, the leader of the
Sylvans.  I rarely ventured out of the Virgin woods, but the note made me
curious, so I headed out to find the note.  As I reached the forest of
Nowhere, I noticed some strange tracks on the path.  I scanned the forest
from where I stood and in the distance I could see the note fluttering in
the wind on the colossal tree.  Suddenly I heard the groan of an ancient
tree-eant to the west.  I found suitable cover, and dashed quietly to the
tree.

After that, I fell on my behind and watched the deer use the last of its
energy coming towards me.  Then, it collapsed.  My brothers didn't know why,
but I did.  I ran to tell my father that his deer had fallen out.  I told
him I let it out to feed it and let it run about, but when I returned from
gathering food for it, it was on the ground.  My sad father came and
examined the deer, and his sadness quickly turned to rage.  He had noticed
the injury on the deer.  His eyes bounced from son to son until they fell
upon my oldest brother, who was the only one of us who had a real weapon. 
Of course, my brother tried to prove his innocence by saying it wasn't him
(a terrible plea), but the blood on his weapon was more than enough proof
for my father.  
 
He was whipped and he didn't eat supper.  Not only that, but he was
forced to complete all of the chores we usually do together.  The day I
killed that deer, I killed two birds with one stone.  I ended my career as
an animal caretaker, and I got back at my brother for all of his past crimes
against me.  I also gained my nickname, which I now use as my last name. 
After I revealed my plan to my brothers, they began to call me Kitsune. 
Kitsune means Fox where I'm from.

The deer had come back with a vengeance, and was now relentlessly trying
to kick me with his hooves!  I had felt that first kick, and I knew I didn't
want to feel another one.  I used all of my imaginary military know how to
dodge and deflect the deer's onslaught.  My brothers, who had let their
pretend enemies take a rest, were now cheering me on!  That was the first
time I felt the heat of a real battle, and the last time I got
swollen-headed in a fight.  I began to show-off for my siblings by meeting
the deers attacks with my stick.  But then, the deer came up on his hind
legs and CRUNCH!  My jo stick was broken!  But the deer wasn't satisfied. 
Oh no, he was far from it.  He began to chase me around our home, and my
brothers only laughed as they watched me run for my life.  Well, I finally
grew tired of this chase.  I ran towards my brothers, and i stealthily drew
my oldest brother's dagger from its sheathe.
 
The next time me and the dear ran around the house, I stopped and let the
deer come up on its hind legs.  When it did, I cut it deep in its chest and
kept running.  I was surprised that the deer was still willing to pursue me,
but I was also glad, because it would make my plan easier.  As I ran around
our abode again, I barreled into my oldest brother and put his dagger back
into its sheathe.  He was so involved in my misfortune, he didn't notice.

Salutations Advil Glahtin.  I am called Takeshi Kitsune.  My first name
means brave where I'm from, and it is what I circle my story around.  Long
ago when I was but a child, my brothers and myself used to imagine we were
real samurai, slaying our enemies in glorious showdowns and paying homage to
our lords.  At this particular time, our father owned a herd of beautiful
deer.  In this herd, there was one deer that my father loved more than all
of the rest.  I have no idea why, but he did.  As much as he loved this
animal, he would never take care of it himself.  He always sent me or one of
my brother to clean it and feed it and do anything else he would want done. 
Being the youngest son of six, I was always the one being made to tend to
this deer.  So one fine spring day when me and my brothers were involved in
an exciting battle, I screamed out "The enemy has sent forth his mystical
beast!  Stand down my brothers, I will cut it down!"
 
It was then I thought, why fight an imaginary monster when I can fight a
real monster?  Besides, I had to live up to my name.  So I ran to the
special pen where my father kept his prized deer and started to poke him
with my jo stick, just to get him excited.  "Oh foul beast!  What's the
matter?  Have you met your match this day?"  I bravely shouted as I
relentlessly prodded this creature.  Then I whispered " Now for the ki-" and
the wind was knocked from my chest!  I was interrupted by a hoof!

A Childhood Transgression
Written by Takeshi
 
(winner of a story contest set up by the world famous bard,
Afvril Galthin)
 
As the large, muscular bodyguard wearing the Ruler insignia entered the
Laughing Pig, every head looked in his direction.  Some patrons even got up
to offer him a seat.  The bodyguards voice boomed "I seek the one known as
Advil Glathin."  After failing to recieve any responses, he took a second
look at the parchment he held in his hand.  He studied it for a moment and
said " My apologies, I meant Afvril Galhtin."
 
The people in the inn tried hard to stifle their laughter, but snickers
escaped unfortunate mouths.  The bodyguard, already upset for some reason or
another, glared around to room to silence the crowd.  "I am Avril Galhtin." 
, a voice coming from near the bars cried out.  The bodyguard made his way
through the frozen crowd and said to Avril "This is for you."  Avril
unrolled the scroll and breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing it was only
another tale from an adventurer.  As the bodyguard made his way out of the
inn, Avril called out to him and said "Why are you so upset?"  And the
bodyguard replied " Do I look like a messenger to you?"  And with that he
stormed out of the inn.  Avril only shrugged his shoulders as he began to
read his latest entry.

"The Scourge shall come to Thera, awoken and risen from their slumber by
the Acolytes of Death, who shall scry and make discovery of their necessity.
Blackness shall eclipse the land, and creatures wrought of night itself
shall run amuck, harbingers of dread, fear, and death.  Thera shall be
ensconced thus, and the darkness shall suppress futile uprisings that
attempt to threaten its hold; heroes shall burst forth in their time of
need, to take up the fight against The Scourge.  However, these heroes shall
in time fall; their brief surges of heroicism and bravery staunched by the
heavy blanket of darkness; they shall perish to The Scourge or give in to
its might.  Alliances shall be formed, armistices formed amongst the
warring, and all shall attempt to unify under one flag to push back the
might of The Scourge.  The pacts shall not hold strong, nor prove true when
tested by deceit and greed.  Ambition and lust shall lead to betrayal, and
defeat.  The insiduous might of The Scourge shall prevail, and those not yet
slain nor captured shall inevitably be taken, and surrender to its power. 
For when light diminishes to nothing, darkness shall remain."  
 
Then all went black.

As I pressed my palm against the cool stone surface of the pillar, a
most interesting thing happened. It seemed that part of the magic of the
stone pulled me back to my original astral plane, but there was another,
unexpected force, that pulled me in a completely different direction! I
willed myself to return to my home astral plane, but my fate was left to the
will of the stone. After what felt like an eternity of being pulled and
stretched in two opposite directions, I felt the force of my home plane
begin to dwindle, and I started to be pulled into the new one! This was not
right, I remember thinking to myself, I must go home! Alas, I was helpless
to the power of the stone, and could do nothing to stop it.
 
The next thing I remember is waking up groggily in a crowded market
square, surrounded by intrigued people of a multitude of races. Arials,
humans, gnomes, elves, dwarves; they all stared down at my sprawled body as
if I was an omniscient demon of some sort. As I started to sit up, I looked
down at my hands, felt my eyes go wide. My skin had turned completely black!
No longer did I have the familiar leathery yellow githyanki skin, but a
smooth, rich black skin now encompassed my body. As I brought my arm up
to my face in disbelief, I noticed an intricate pattern on my skin, it
almost looked like....letters. When I examined it more closely, the letters
on my skin glowed a bright flame-red, and I began to speak. I spoke as
if another being inhabited my body; my own mind was pushed to the back of my
conscience, I could not control myself! I heard myself speak eerily, in a
powerful voice that I have never before used, I addressed the crowd
surrounding me and spoke with authority and clarity in a prophetic voice:

All of that brief scuffle took but a heartbeat or two, and in that time
the last troll had begun to charge at me. Weary from battling the strong
creatures, I waited until the last insant when its lunge would impale me,
and neatly sidestepped its blade. As I did so, I slammed my elbow into the
small of its back, adding more momentum to its misguided rush. The troll
had too much momentum to regain its balance, and fell heavily to its knees.
Sensing its weakness, I rushed the troll and snaked my blade in and out of
its green chest, and withdrew it quickly. The troll fell to the ground,
landing face down in the grass that had been ripped and torn from our fight.
 
Despite the unnerving encounter, I remember staying completely level-
headed, and pressed on through the ruins, following my intuition more than
my senses. After a short while of navigating the ruins, I came across a
clearing, in the center of which there was a large marble dias. My eyes lit
up with glee as I recognized the glossy black pillar jutting up from the
middle of the dias, and I rushed towards the pillar, and safety.

Trolls.  There were four of them in all, lanky, lumbering beasts that
somehow managed to move about the ruins silently.  One troll alone is a
formidable foe, I knew that from my lessons, but to face four at once? 
Fearing the worst, I scanned their weaponry.  All four carried enormous
scythe-like swords that I would barely be able to wield in two hands.  The
odds for a sword fight did not look good.  Hoping to take them by surprise,
I prepared the necessary incantation for a spell of ice in my mind, and
waited for the moment to unleash it.  Just before they converged upon the
spot where I would have been, I jumped out of my cover and cast my spell in
their center.  An enormous sphere of ice materialized between the four
trolls, and they all shared a split-second look of bemused observation
before the ball exploded.  Ice chunks were flung from the ball with such
force that one of the trolls was impaled through the chest and slain
outright.  The other two sustained grazing wounds from the ice, and probably
suffered a momentary chill.  I knew that they would recover shortly, so I
pressed my advantage before it disappeared and leaped amidst them, swinging
my blade high with as much force as I could muster.  One of the trolls was
too slow in regaining his bearings, and my swordtip neatly slit his leathery
throat.  The second troll was not so befuddled, and brought its massive
blade up to parry my swing just before it would have lopped its head off. 
Sparks flew from our clash of blades, its strength was so great, and my
sword-arm was jarred so badly I nearly lost my grip.  Knowing such a mistake
would be fatal, I regripped my sword and neatly rolled away from the trolls
to take up a defensive stance.  I had just stood up and balanced my footing
on the slippery grass when the troll who parried my blow slashed at me, his
scythe of a sword cutting a swathe through plants and air alike as it
screamed toward my torso.  In an instant I deemed the force of the swing too
great to block easily, and ducked beneath the horizontal blow.  As I ducked,
I moved in closer to the troll, where his long blade would be much less
effective, and jabbed the pommel of my sword into its soft belly, expelling
the air from its lungs.  The troll's recoiling step was all the opportunity
I needed, and I lunged towards it, sinking my blade deep into its chest as I
pounced.

My purpose renewed by this ominous greeting, I hurried on in the
direction from which I perceived the voice.  It seemed to come from the
heart of the ruins, so I pressed on relentlessly.  The lush plantlife would
have made the voyage pleasantly scenic, if it did not block my path at ever
turn.  My blade was soon tinged green from slicing through the rebellious
flora, it was no way to treat a sword.  I was abruptly called from my musing
to a near- silent crunching of grass underfoot to my left; whoever
approached had done so quite guilefully until he was betrayed by the grass. 
I spun quickly and retreated away from the brush while assuming a warrior's
stance to give myself proper space to swing my blade, and be ready to meet
my stealthful hunter.  Suddenly I noticed there was not a single hunter, but
many, and they approached from all sides!  Assessing the situation quickly,
I trusted that they would have no arcane ability and focused my magical
power while reciting the familiar incantations for invisibility.  A brief
tingling passed through my body, as if an electric current touched every
part of my body, and I faded out of existance.  Although hidden from sight,
I knew that the spell would do nothing to cover any noise that I made, so I
stepped silently through the plants until I caught a glimpse of my hunters.

Today was the day when I would undertake my final examination before one
assumes the rank of Initiate Anti-Paladin.  I was such an apt pupil that the
elders who were administering my test had decided to bring out a magical
artifact, one that had not been used in centuries.  It was a large pillar of
pure black stone, but was otherwise unremarkable.  I had been isntructed
that to start the test, all I had to do was touch the pillar.  Gingerly I
reached out my hand to it, my fingers nearly touching the glossy black
surface.  In that moment, I am not sure what happened; I began to hesitate,
but with some inner force, the pillar pulled my hand to its unnaturally cool
surface.  Being pulled through that ancient portal was difficult in itself;
I felt contorted and stretched, as if my own body were being turned inside
out and reverted back to normal by playful hands.  Eventually the abuse
subsided, and I felt my cheek slam painfully into cold stone ground.  I got
up dazedly, and surveyed my surroundings.  
 
I stood in the ruins of a once-magnificent fortress, yet the resemblence
was not great. The heavy stone walls were reduced to piles of rubble, and
sprouts of lively green plants and weeds shot up wherever I looked. Despite
the ruin's lush plantlife, it seemed devoid of any other lifeforms. I quickly
scanned about, but saw only a brown cloak covering a bulgy object that didn't
quite belong. I walked carefully over the the bundle, and discovered an old
if still serviceable longsword, as well as a pile of burnished armor. I tried
them on, and was surprised to find that they fit perfectly--even the grip of
the blade seemed made for my hand. Properly outfitted, I had just begun to
walk about the ruins when a voice boomed in my head, filling my mind
painfully with its presence. It spoke: "Come to me, young Knight, and I shall
test your skills. Defeat me and return to whence you came a stronger man, or
fall and be forever forgotten."

The Dark Prophecy
Written by Fyrael
 
(winner of a contest held by the world famous bard Afvril Galthin)
 
The door to the inn creaks open and shut quickly, revealing a glimpse of
the darkened sky hurling rain and lightning bolts at the earth ferociously.
A tall, lithe man walks into inn from the storm; he carries a long scroll
rolled up in his hands, which are black as night. He meticulously unfurls
the scroll, and begins reading in a deep, clear voice:

Someone has told me a rather silly legend; that if you dig and dig inside
the corpse of the {mmidnight{z {Ddragon{z, you can find a heart-shaped ruby.
He also said it would be of great interest to the air dragon, the guardian
of knowledge, but he didn't tell me why. But he was incredibly drunk anyway,
so I doubt he was telling any sort of truth. What a lush.
 
I believe I'll be setting off for the westlands today; I've got it in my mind
that I absolutely MUST own me a bracer like Rahl's. I've seen a friend wearing
one, and it does wonders for his sword swing. I could deffinately use any help
I can get; Elial has been hunting down each and every one of my friends, one
by one. I'm sure I'm next.

Well, some members of the Hunter clan were going to go with me to Lom'Tak,
but no one has been able to find it; it's as though it's disappeared from
the face of the earth! Quite strange, really. I've noticed an insurgance of
very malicious evil in the land, lately; the ranks of Necromancers and Anti-
Paladins has nearly doubled in the last year. It's nothing threatening now,
but it's worrisome. I've been giving thought to what I might eventually have
to do if the trend continues; being one of the last Crusaders of Skyflash,
it would be my responsibility to don the relics of Lode and seek out the
evil of the land, until it was no longer a threat; I'm just petrified of
how I would ask the lord. What would I say? I wonder if I'd have the nerve;
asking him for the Lode relics is not a light thing to do. No one has worn
them in 2000 years.

Times have been very rough. While roaming around the forest west of
Midgaard, some wolves attacked me; I dispatched them easily, but then a
ranger saw what I had done, and practicly went into a frenzy. Nearly took
my head off with his axe! I barely escaped, and he's been hunting me ever
since. I paid Ciquala a visit, and took everything there was to take. I
had expected more resistance, but perhaps I'm getting stronger than I know.
Tomorrow, I intend to head towards Mt. Doom, where a stronghold with many
dragons in it's upper towers awaits my sword. The going price for dragon-
scale and dragon-claw merchandise is something too high to ignore.

Raided the castle. Sure enough, 500 gold. Definately worth the effort.
Tomorrow, I plan on heading towards the west, down the river that goes
through Midgaard, towards the High Tower of Sorvery. I hear there's lots of
great treasure to be had there, though one must be careful not to anger any
of the more powerful residents on the upper floors... After that, I think
I might finally work up the courage to pay Ciquala a visit.

I've been neglecting this journal lately, but I haven't really done much, so
there isn't much to report. I went back to Midgaard and spent a few days
there, then went after a headsman named Ceurvo in a city called Anon.
He was a tough fellow, but he was no match for me. His axe is fearsome, but
far too heavy for a graceful fighter such as myself. Tomorrow, I hope to
head towards a ruined castle east of the Castle of Giants; I hear there's
a treasure being guarded by a Mimic, and the trip, while dangerous, would
be very profitable.

Made it to Sentua, and snooped around for a while; in the weaponshop, there's
a back room with a safe, and sure enough, Pinkerton was working on it. I
managed to get the jump on him, and he fell quickly, but he didn't seem to
have anything on him. What's more of interest, though, was what I found
beyond the safe-room... there's a basement, and in there, there was some
sort of strange beast being held in a cell! When I rouse him, he attacked,
and after a long battle, I managed to defeat him. What was most noteworthy,
though, is what I found on his body afterwards... some sort of strange,
pulsing blade! When I hold it in my hands, I feel much stronger than usual.
I feel it will become very useful in the days to come.

Back from the mountains. I've got the relic, and it's powers are very
useful. Hope to find some more relics soon. Someone mentioned a black mask
that a thief named Pinkerton is rumored to have. Somewhere in the sands of
sorrow, there's a city call Sentua, and he's supposed to be there. We'll
see.

Made it to New Thalos. What a rich place! I love the dry climate. A big
change from Skyflash. I hear there's a few clanhalls around here, but I've
never had enough energy to go look for them. Besides, most of those cult-
like freaks get pretty upset when you show up on their doorstep. Still
looking around for that rug-shop for the dragon king. Someone said it was
somewhere around the center of town. If all goes well, tomorrow I intend to
set off to the mountains and claim my reward for all this travel.

I start this journal in the hopes of keeping a catalogue of my exploits, and
also in the hopes that someday someone may find it, and find it's contents
useful in their own exploits. In it, I hope to write about various places
I've been, and things I've seen. Not much more to say today; on my way from
the Valley of the Titans to New Thalos, which should be a tiring journey. I
wish that Sky Highway that that young ninja I grew up with, Angelo, would
have been built. It would save me much time...

old book journal ancient~
It looks to be the journal of an adventurer of some forgotten era.  The
inside cover has writing in red ink: 
 
{R'This book contains the life and times of Seraphon, the arial warrior of
Skyflash.'{z
 
It seems many of the pages have decayed over time. Only a few remain.
 
(You can read individual pages by typing '{Wlook #{z'.)

I am not sure about all information in this book, because the adventurer
who told me the story was not...........................................
Firstly you will need a dress for the keeper. You may find a suitable
dress in the general store in New Thalos area. Say to shopkeeper keeper
( say keeper) and he will help you. Now you need a beautiful rug for the
Fireflash who has the key of kassandra. Fireflash interests only with special
rug which has been sold by art dealer in Valley of Titans area. Now, you
should find the keeper who will unlocks the gate to you against the
dress. I don't know the exact place of the keeper and Fireflash,
but I heard that they are in an area which includes many pixies and
dragons. As you give the dress to keeper he will helps you. And now you
should give rug to Fireflash. Now you have a key find the Paladin who is
responsible for the stone kassandra. Adventured said me that you may find
that paladin in the south and up of the Midgaard. 
	Usage of the kassandra is very easy, as you are holding it say :
 "kassandra, or sebat"
           e.g.  say kassandra
                   say sebat

{@@The Temple Of Midgaard{x~
You are in the southern portion of the temple hall in Midgaard.  The
temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in appearance.
Many of the walls are covered by highly detailed wall paintings picturing
ancient gods, giants, and peasants.  Large steps lead down through the grand
temple gate, descending the huge mound upon which the temple is built and
ending on the temple square below.  A smaller set of marble steps off to the
left leads {&UP {xthrough a doorway into the entrance {xto the {^TRAINING ACADEMY{x.
To the east lies an open door leading to the {#Quest {xmaster of Midgaard.
A small plaque is on the wall.

An acrid smell fills this large room.  Along the walls are numerous

hangs a big iron pot with boiling water.  In the middle of the room is a
large oak table.

Hovel of Blindobandres the Sage~
You have entered the run down hovel of Blindobandres, the gnomish sage. 
An incredible variety of assorted artifacts and junk litter numerous shelves
on the walls.  A wolf skull grins at you from atop a jumbled mass of
parchments and unfurled scrolls.  There seems to be little of true value in
this room, yet Blindobandres holds every article dear.  You had best not
touch anything.  A low, and poorly framed door leads east.
 
  To Use the Sage:
                  identify <object>
                       e.g. identify helm

relax and read one of the books from the bookshelf on the northern wall.

filled with locals and travelers alike, some looking as though they have
come a long way to reach the city.  The atmosphere of the inn is warm and
cheerful, and the room is filled with laughter, patrons gathering together
after a long day to tell tales over mugs of ale.  The common room is
brightly lit, and the sounds of flutes drift over the voices of its patrons,
playing a lively tune.

It almost feels as if the shadows themselves cause sound to be muted

Only a few tables are placed in this corner of the inn, and the patrons who
occupy them do not seem to be the type who find themselves inclined to dance
and laugh.  The nearest window is too far to lend any illumination, and not
a single lamp or candle lies nearby to dispel the darkness.  The shadows are
deep enough to hide the features of most who sit in the alcove, and the rest
of the inn's patrons seem to avoid looking in this direction.

The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival

guidelines~
{W1){x Using a mixture of words and pictures is effective
strategy for compressing the size of large maps.
 
I.E. You can simply use {YINN {W->{x to signify the hotel
that won't even fit on your map normally.
 
{W2){x Maps CAN be split sensically into smaller maps
for distinctly seperate areas within areas. For example,
the maze in dwarven daycare could warrant its own map.
 
{W3){x A generalized concept of where everything is in
relationship to everything else is more important than detail,
detail, detail.
 
{W4){x Alphanumeric directions are acceptable for sprawling
areas. For example, a generalized map of Midgaard might fit in a
10x15 square, with directions to the side, saying "Bakery (1w,1n)"
But let's not spoon-feed everything. Keep alphanumeric directions
for the most needful situations.
~
E
rules~
{W1){x Maps must have a width of 80 characters or less. A {Ycartographers
ruler{x is on display to aid you in correct formatting. {DCopy and paste into
notepad if it helps.{x
 
{W2){x Be concise, short, and simple. It's more important to explain that an
inn exists in the Southern-Central part of the Village, rather than explain
that it's actually a 6-story plaza hotel with a bathroom for each bedroom.
 
{W3){x Effective use of {Rcolors{x and {mpictographs{x are very good at condensing
maps. a {GLEGEND{x may or may not be required. It's easier to learn
an area by getting a rough layout, instead of an all-inclusive, all-
rooms-named approach.
 
{W4){x Whenever possible, follow proper NESWDU orientation for describing
how to get from A to B.

A Lavish Room at the Inn~
This room is quite spacious, almost big enough to fit a modest sized
house inside.  A large bed dominates the room, wide enough for several
people to sleep in comfortably.  The sheets appear to be made of silk, and
the pillows are amazingly soft.  A large chest stands at the foot of the
bed, and a wardrobe stands against the wall ready to hold the fine silks and
linens of the room's occupants.  A smaller open room holds a marble bathtub,
ready to be filled with a single word to the maids.  
       A small sign has been placed by the door.

A Lavish Room at the Inn~
Fit for any noble, this room is filled with almost everything gold can
buy.  Fine vases set on stands add a splash of colour to the white walls,
complemented by tapestries and masteful paintings.  A large bed stands near
the center of the room, will lovely silk sheets and goose feather pillows. 
A tall gilt-worked chest stands at the foot of the bed, and a wardrobe has
been made available to store the typically large collection of outfits for
the nobles who spend the night here.

A Lavish Room at the Inn~
The large window set into the eastern wall gives a fantastic view of the
city, as well as the trees and mountains beyond.  The window is left open
slightly, allowing a gentle breeze to cool the room and whisk the curtains
back and forth.  A large bed with lovely sheets of pale silk is the most
noticeable feature of the room, wide enough to fit several people, but by no
means is it the most beautiful piece.  A gilt-worked chest is placed against
the far wall, and a lovely marble bathtub can be seen in a small open room
to the south.  Freshly picked wildflowers fill vases scattered about the
room, filling the space with a pleasant scent and a splash of vibrant
colour.

{BThe Parchment Shop{x~
The parchment shop is a musty little room covered on all sides with large
cases that hold shelves and shelves of parchment.  All different types of
parchment line the walls of the store, there are small, thin parchments,
there are thick, bold parchments, there are even different colors of
parchments!  Near the back of the store is a small wooden counter, behind
which the shopkeeper resides and sells his goods.

A Money Changer's Room~
A few strategically placed lanterns keep this place well-lit in the 
absence of any windows.  The room is surprisingly well appointed with  
tapestries hanging on the walls.  You'd wager your life the moneylender's
guards are behind them, as there are none here.  The moneylender himself
works from behind a large desk, no doubt holding a fortune in gold and silver.
A smallish sign hangs on the wall, lettered in common.

Grebe's Tavern~
A dive.  That's about all you can say about this place.  It's a dive. 
You step carefully over the dead and drunk sailors lying on the floor and
walk to the middle of the room.  There are no decorations on the walls,
they've all been ripped down by sailors during the many brawls that take
place here for use as weapons at one time or another.  Looking around you
search vainly for a clean table to sit at, then give up.  A small doorway at
the back of the room leads to the entrance hall of the warlock's guild.

Map Guidelines
   In relating to your house{R-{xbuilder, the design of your house has to follow the
following specifications:
1) Mapped rooms must be numbered, 01{R-{x25
2) Directions are to be designated as follows:
                    N U
                    {R|{x{R/{x
                  W{R-{x+{R-{xE
                   {R/{x{R|{x
                  D S
3) "E" designates entrances. "{C<{x,{C>{x,V,{C^{x" indicate 1{R-{xways. "{R|{x,{R-{x" indicate 2{R-{xways.
3) Feel free to use as much space for your map as necessary. Clarity is more
   important than compaction. Exceptions are mazes: Those have to be described
    verbally.
