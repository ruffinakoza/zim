Name:   Tyrannosaurus Rex  Danger: Major
Type:   Giant Bipedal Carnivore
This aggressive, powerful creature is equipped with     
a 4 foot long maw filled with up to 60 serrated teeth   
that grow up to 9 inches in length. It walks upon two   
powerful long legs that allow it to run in short        
bursts. It's preferred method is to trample its prey,   
and cause as much damage in an initial attack. Though   
it is capable of hunting, it doesn't mind scavenging    
corpses, either. Though its forelimbs seem shriveled    
and weak, they are still capable of lifting 450 lbs.    
Noteably, they are used to hold and carry an un-
hatched egg.
Dissection of the creature shows hollowed bones which   
lower the weight of the creature, facilitating its      
bursts of speed. Its hind claws provides a minor        
amout of gripping ability, to assist its running and    
trampling of foes.
Height: 23 feet  Length: 50 feet Weight: 7 tons

Sadin's relief~
You are standing in the middle of a large plush jungle.  There are
flowers and exotic vines growing over the tree that cover the ground as far
as the eye can see.  You hear the calls of the multitude animals living in
the trees and forest floor.  Sitting in middle of a small glade rest a
hammock set-up between two trees, with a small table off to the side.  There
is a fresh , clean brook running the outside edge of the glade, filling the
air with the relaxing sound of running water.

Middle Tower Path~
You are getting closer to the tower, which appears to be an abandoned
lighthouse from a time long ago.  You see the glassed panes of the upper
watchtower, remarkable clean considering the state of the tower.  As you
walk along, you notice several corpses along the path, small furry animals
with some very gross sores all over their body.  You begin to wonder if you
should really continue forward.

Upper Tower Path~
You are walking along the edge of a steep cliff over looking the Dragon
Sea.  To the north, you can just make out the entrance to the tower, which
appears to have some kind of guard stationed at it.  Off in the distance, in
the middle of the Dragon Sea, you can see the faint outline of an isle of
some kind; although there is no dock or any noticeable path to reach it, you
wonder if it is occupied.  As you walk long, you think you can hear a faint
rustling in the brush.

Path to the Tower~
You are walking toward the tower, along a stone paved path.  The sound of
crashing waves echoes from the cliffs around you.  Upon closer inspection of
the tower, you notice that it is made of polished black marble that reflects
the sunlight back out to sea.  You also notice several strange symbols over
the door leading into the tower: a picture of an ancient dragon, the seal of
New Thalos, and a symbol you do not recognize.  You can walk up the to the
door, or return back the way you came.

Entrance to Chronomancer's Tower~
You stand before a simple wooden door that does not seem to be locked. 
Of course the fact that a grim looking Death Knight stands to the left side
of the door could be the reason the owner has no need to lock the door. 
You glance at the Death Knight and shiver, hoping he will not be unhappy
that you have disturbed his master.  The door swings slightly in the breeze,
inviting you to enter and discover your fate among the sands of time.

worse from the inside then it did from the outside.  There is debris
everywhere, as if a struggle took place and everything that wasn't bolted
down was knocked over.  There are doors leading north and west, as well as a
spiral staircase leading upward, toward a bizarre blue glowing light.

The Kichen~
You have entered the kitchen for this abandoned lighthouse.  Much to your
surprise, this room is completely clean and stocked with fresh food and drink.
You see bags of flour, barley and wheat stacked in one corner as well as
jars of pickled fruits and eggs.  There is a large pot of simmering soup,
hanging over a bed of glowing embers, implying that somebody is here to tend to
the fire.  There is small door along the east wall, leading to a pantry. 
You think you can hear a voice from the pantry, cursing the bad luck they
are having.

a bed covered in dark down furs.  There is a torch attached to the wall next
to the bed, flickering as if a breeze were blowing upon the flame.  This is
unusual, since there is not a single window in the room.  Maybe it is your
fatigue getting the best of you, or there is something that more then meets
the eye here.

are full sized bookshelves on the three walls, all filled to capacity with
different volumes on time, space and magic.  There are also two long tables,
each with 4 chairs along each side.  There are several books upon each

three walls, there are full time maps, each with varying details.  Below
each map is a sheet of parchment that seems to explain the map and what it
repents.  Along the north wall is a rough map with the title: Ancient Times,
the west wall contains a map of New Thalos with the title: Present Day and
the south wall contains a very detailed map with the title: Zsezhar, which
the mage has translated into the word: Chicago.

warm and sweat starts forming along your brow.  You see a large oak door
with a bizarre keyhole, which seems to be made of a swirling mass of sand,
with no visible opening for a key.  You start to wonder how much more of
this strange tower you can endure.

You have entered a large room that pulsates with magical energy.  In the
center of the room stands a glowing {Bblue{x portal that seems to flash every
couple minutes and emits a faint humming sound.  There are no other objects
that you can see and the portal seems to draw you closer to it.  As you
approach it, you suddenly remember the saying etched above the outside door:
Enter and discover your fate among the sands of time.  Could this be the
fabled Chronomancers time portal, rumored to have been hunted down and destroyed
by the Warlock clan so long ago?

symbol identifying the period in time, which the portal takes you.  You

yellow hue to them, with a single door on the west wall.  Your heart sinks
when you realize that the room is empty and no portals are located here; you
must explore the strange new land and hope you can find the way home.

you descend down into the darkness, you begin to feel very light-headed. 
All of a sudden, you get a piercing pain stabbing throughout your chest and
stomach.  As you wrap your arms around your midsection, as if that will help
the pain subdue, you realize that you have let go of the ladder.  You
attempt to grab a rung and miss, as you tumble down the chute you think to
yourself, must learn to read and follow posted signs.  Suddenly, your head

body of water to the west, you assume it is the Dragon Sea, although a sign
claims it to be "Lake Michigan".  The beach continues north until it
dead-ends at some kind of roadway, which leads to a very large pier.  To the
south it leads to a large marina filled with boats.  There are sounds of
wild animals coming from the east, which seems to lead into a large park.

deserted.  At the very end of the pier, standing taller then anything you
have ever seen is a colossal wheel covered in torches with about 30 cages
attached to the inner part of the structure.  You feel the urge to
investigate this item further.

Forbidden Tunnel~
As you continue to descend further into the darkness, you start to feel a
familiar tingle of magic in your bones.  You glance down and see a faint
glow from the bottom of the shaft, the portal home you hope.  You also hear
a voice in your head, whispering "Bring me the ring", and you start to
wonder what it means.

Entrance to the Portal Room~
You stand at the entrance to a large cavern, directly north of you. 
Although, you can see the cavern and everything in it, you can't gain
access.  Some sort of energy field prevents any movement toward the portal
room, then you notice a shadow in the corner.

stand three portals, similar to the ones in the original chamber.  There is
nothing else in the room, you take a deep breath and enter one, but to where
will it take you?

Lincoln Park North~
The northern part of the park is next to a busy road, which is filled
with very strange vehicles.  They have four wheels but no horse, yet move
with amazing speed.  There is a path leading east that follows the fence
around a curve.  The road can be crossed, if you are quick on your feet. 
There is also a path to the west leading to a large floating pier.

coiled snake, both willing and able to eat you for lunch.  The bright lights
make you squint and you wonder how anything can live under these conditions.

the tank but you have no idea what they are.  As you peer into the watery
depths, you notice that there are windows built into the sides of the tank,
about fifteen feet under the water level.  You figure it must provide a
unique point of view to watch these creatures from below.  
This is a large warning sign attached to a pole nearby.

leads west to east.  Peering westward you see a large store that looks busy,
a good sign that they have good stuff, you hope.  East leads toward a slum
type area, and looks unsafe to visit alone.

northwest a large strong building looms on the horizon.  The many vehicles
on this road are careless and nearly hit you several times.  It may be
safest to find a new route.

color, which is disturbing.  There is also a very tall building to the

Dead End~
The shadows of the surrounding buildings plunges this area into darkness.
There is no exit from this area, save the south, back toward the light. 
There are piles of trash and you think you see a dead corpse, half buried,
in the pile.  A tough looking thug whispers for you to come over here; and
you start to feel very unsafe here, and decide it is time to leave, and
quickly.

Path to Bank~
This non-descriptive stretch of road seem to lead directly to the doors
of a large brick building.  Based on the fact that it says, "Bank" above the
doors, you can assume it is a bank.  The path leads west right up to the
doors and no other paths lead off of the main one.  East heads back toward
the bust intersection you just left.

located all around it, with the bartender in the middle.  There are a few
tables located along the far wall, but they are empty.  To the south, you
can return to the food hall and leave.  You notice the bar has a small sign
attached to it, maybe you should read it.

A Busy Avenue~
The stairs exit directly onto a sidewalk along a very busy looking road. 
There are many long box like vehicles that are load and have doors on the
side.  They are filled with people, yet they seem very happy being inside
the beast.  The road leads north toward yet another road or south toward a
new set of steps that lead down.  You also hear the sounds of the river to
the west.

Adams Street~
You are standing on start of a large metal bridge that spans across a
very green river.  To the west you can see a large building with a large
cross on it.  As the river flows below you, you notice that small path runs
along the river on one side, although you are unsure of how to reach it. 
This place is starting to grate on the nerves, you wish you could find the
way home.

A large metal bridge spans a great river here, with the bridge leading
east.  To the west you can see the entrance to the build with the cross on
it.  Below the bridge flows a rather green colored river, although you
notice a small door located along the opposite bank, which has a small path
leading to it.  To the northeast, you see a large slum looking area, filled
with rundown buildings.

Adams Street~
The road you are on has reached a dead end.  There is an entrance into a
large building to the north, yet again equipped with magic doors that open
without help.  From here, you notice lots of people wear white coats running
around the inside of the building and a few people push large carts with
people on them, possibly dead or injured warriors.  There is a faint aura of
death, but a much more powerful aura of life and healing from this place. 
If you don't wish to enter the building you may retreat back down the street
to the east.

building as well as a stairwell leading upward.  On the wall next to you is
a list of areas, along with which floor and direction they are located.  In
the middle of the room is a large desk, occupied by a friendly receptionist
to help direct lost visitors.  You notice a sign has been posted on the
desk, you better read it.

This passage leads directly north, leading you deeper into the building. 
There is a door to the left and the passage continues north to a closed door
at the end of the passage.  All around, there is activity and you have to
keep moving, least you get run over by the crowds.  There is also a voice,
which is heard everywhere yet you are unable to locate the source, informing
you of the cleanness policy.

of the ceiling is a large box with a tube sticking out of it, as if it were
about to fire a weapon at you.  There is also a large glass bulb that is
flashing red, with a sign warning "Stay clear when light is solid."  You
figure it is best to leave now, before you wake up the sleeping beast.

it.  Not even the best lock-picking thief would stand a chance at this lock,
which seems to mock you.  The door states "Restricted Access: Authorized
Personal Only" and guess what, you are not authorized.  You have no choice
but to head back to the south and main lobby.

the food area is current closed.  There is a door leading south, onto a
small patio.  There are a few people eating at various tables throughout the
area, but they all ignore you.

tables out here, all are full with no place for you to sit down at.  There
are small birds scattered around; looking for scraps dropped by the
occupants of the tables.  There is no exit from the patio other then to

floor with various doors leading into small rooms along the outer wall. 
There is a desk set-up along a large window, where you check-in to see the
healers.  A very large sign grabs your attention, better read it.

The road travels along the river leading in a north-south direction. 
Despite the lack of any stores or other business, this road is full of
vehicles and people rushing around.  To the north a goodly distance you see
an intersection with yet another even busier road, while south leads toward
a large partly buried building.  You also notice a small metal gate, which
is blocking access to a ladder leading down to the river.

consists of a large jungle gym, swings, merry go-round, and several sand
boxes.  There are a few children playing with an adult watching over them. 
If you head north, you see a row of shops.

unusual, since most water your have always seen is clear.  Just across the
river you see an intersection with yet another road, which seem to
criss-cross the city.  Just on the other side of the bridge, you see a small
store, which appears closed.

west.  An unnamed avenue heads north, with a small row stores along the
south edge.  It appears however that all the stores are closed.  Directly to
the east, starts the slummy area of the city, with what appears only one
building still in standing condition, and that not saying much.

Start of the Slums~
The change here is staggering, within the course of one block the
condition of the building and overall quality of the city has plummeted. 
Most of the buildings have been sprayed with graffiti and almost all of them
have wood covering the broken out windows.  There is a large open area to
the east and an entrance to the only "stable" looking building this area to
the north.  You notice that everyone is staring at you, and you begin to
feel uncomfortable.

adults engage in some sort of play.  To the north is a basket, mounted on a
long pole.  With people throwing a ball into it, while to the east a large
group is scattered about crashing a small ball hit by a long stick.  Most of
the people glance over then ignore you, however a few start heading toward
you from the south.

windows are almost all broken and are covered with boards to keep out the
elements.  Amazingly the front door is still standing and it appears fairly
sturdy as well.  Somebody has posted a sign on the door that you could read.

of tenants and a small trashcan.  There is an another door at the northern
end of the hallway, which appears broken and will not remain locked.  The
flickering light above your head reminds you of the danger of being in such
an unstable building.

marked as 102.  The stairs leading up are spiral in design and very tight,
since the building hallways are extremely narrow.  The overwhelming smell of
cooked cabbage lingers in the air, making you feel sick.

Darkness embraces as you enter this tunnel; All the light from the

sounds of scratching and squeals can be heard, the sounds echoing back and
forth along the stone walls and metal pipes above your head.  The flickering
of your lights reveals a sign attached to the wall in front of you, with
what appear to be directions.  Despite the strength in your heart, you start
to get butterflies in your stomach.

The tunnel joins into a much larger tunnel that leads both north and
south.  The new tunnel is filled with water, about 4 feet deep, you would
guess.  Looking at the water, several dark shapes dark around, quickly
moving from place to place.  You hear the thundering sound of what sounds
like a waterfall, but such a thing can't be underground, can it?

You are floating in the middle of a huge pond with several cascading
waterfalls crashing all around you, creating a small wave effect on the
surface of the water.  A bump on the boat causes you to jump in fright as
you stare into the inky water, and notice a large scaly tail swimming past. 
You notice that the ladder you came down is the only means out and start
paddle toward it, rapidly.  Suddenly, there is a roar behind you and the
feel hot breath on the back of your neck...

Long Tunnel~
The lack of noticeable anything in the tunnel is depressing.  It seems to
go on forever with nothing but gray stone everywhere you look.  Peering
forward, you think you can make out a small tunnel branching off, but you
are not sure.  The echo of your footsteps is the only company you have.

Fork in the Tunnel~
The tunnel splits into two directions one leading west while the other
heads south.  There is a faint glow coming from the westward tunnel that
creates a curious effect of the walls.  You can see a small gate at the end
of the south tunnel.  There is a small sign posted on the wall in front of

A Glowing Tunnel~
As you approach a large room ahead, the glowing continues to get brighter
and stronger.  It does not appear to come from the walls themselves, rather
a reflection from an unknown source.  Ahead you see a large {Yyellow{x sign
which looks very important.  A slight splashing can be heard, as if near a
pond that is gently lapping at its shores.

Above the Cooling Pools~
A small walkway made of metal supports you, as you walk above four large
glowing pools of water.  The air is also much warmer in here then it was in
the tunnel from which you just came, although you can not fathom why.  Along
the ceiling there are small glass globes that are glowing with a bright

water.  It seems a drip in the ceiling has been allowed to collect over time
creating this puddle, based on the location you figure you are under the
large river you saw earlier.  A small decomposing corpse lies next to the
water.

then, darkness surrounds you.  The walls seem to close in around you as you
climb higher into the darkness.  The air suddenly begins to get very cold,
and you can see your breath when you exhale.

Crude Stairwell~
The stairwell continues upward while turning to the left at the same
time.  The top of the stairwell is bathed in sunlight, indicating a way out
of here.  A brisk breeze from above chills you to the very bone.  The smell
of roasting meat wafts up from the lower level, inviting to sit and have a
meal.

A Narrow Cliff Path~
The path is extremely narrow here with a very, very, very long drop to
the bottom.  The bitter chill in the air starts to make your toes and
fingers go numb.  A powerful wind blows all around you, threatening to blow
you off the cliff.  You notice a series of caves above up, some with smoke
blowing out of them, maybe people will to share a warm blanket.

Bitterly Cold Mountain Pass~
Snow drifts are starting to form along the cliff wall, making the path
even narrower.  The path curves around several large bounders, probably here
from a prior landslide.  There is a dark patch lying next to one of the
boulders, although it is hard to see what it is.  A howling can be heard
echoing around the valley.

Large boulders cover the ground making it difficult to continue forward. 
It appears the latest landslide was recently as a fresh corpse is dead,
crushed under the weight of a huge boulder.  There is a slight chance you
could climb over the boulders, however should you slip and fall; it would be
most painful.

The wind continues to freeze you to the bone, causing you to shiver. 
Tall walls of solid stone lie on each side of the path causing the wind to
seem colder, sucking the life from your chilled flesh.  A rope ladder is
dangling in the wind, leading upward to a cave entrance.  An unhappy figure
can be seen peering over the edge, looking at you.

As the wind flings you about like a rag doll, you cling to the rope
ladder for dear life.  Thankfully the ladder is well made and does not
appear ready to break.  For some reason, the climb it taking longer then you

reaching up toward the heavens sometimes meeting with the equally impressive
stalactites that drop from the ceiling, like a set of teeth from a long
forgotten beast.  A huge fire burns to the west with a small group huddled

unaware of your presence.  The hall extends in all direction from this point
with tunnels visible along every wall as well as a ladder, located to the
north, leading to an upper level.  The squawk of a bird can be heard echoing
off the wall, making it imposable to locate where it came from.

and beyond that a sea of green grass for as far as the eye can see.  Looking
down, you can see the entire path, which leads up to the palace, an early

Strange Rock Formation~
Although the rock seems natural to the area, the way it has formed looks
artificial.  There is no good reason for this deduction, but it just does. 
As the waves crash over the rocks small pools form within the crevices and
indentations of the rocks.  Small shellfish scatter about each time the
water rushes over them, as if they are looking for the way home.

Walking in the Shallows~
Small waves splash up against your ankles as you wade along close to the
shore.  Small fish swim around, tickling your legs.  Looking out over the
blue waters, you see large creatures surface before disappearing below the
waves again.  The call of the gulls rings out over the beach as they hunt
for food.

Sailing the Forsaken Sea~
The white sands below you vanish as the sea suddenly becomes very deep,
turning the waters a dark blue.  Clouds drift overhead with the gentle
breezes that blow along the calm and peaceful surface.  Small whitecaps
break the surface as small fish leap from the water and gracefully splash
back into the inky depths of the sea.  To the west you can see the sparkling
sands of a white beach.

Sailing the Forsaken Sea~
The deep blue waters of the sea surround you in all directions as far as
the eye can see.  The stillness of the ocean is only broken while a large
animal surfaces for air or looks around for food.  No matter how hard you
try, land is nowhere to be seen, and making you wonder in leaving the beach
was such a good idea after all.  To the east a large green seaweed mass
floats past, making it impossible to go east.

Sailing the Forsaken Sea~
The sea seems much rougher here, despite the lack of any land of shallows
nearby.  The smooth surface is broken with the frequent breaking of
whitecaps of various sizes, although not large enough to swamp you.  There
is also the noticeable lack of life in this immediate area; maybe a large
killer lurks nearby.  You do notice that most of the bubbles on the surface
seem to drift southward with a quick pace.

The Violent Sea~
There is violence in the water that seems alive and wishing to destroy
you and all other thing is this area.  Large waves seem to come from all
directions causing your boat to nearly capsize several times.  Part of the
current seems to rush west while at the same time east, causing a violent
result.  Glancing to the east, you can see a rocky beach beckoning you, if
you can avoid crushing your boat upon the sharp bounders in the process.

The Whirlpool~
Suddenly this seems the worst place to be at the current time.  The once
calm sea suddenly turns into a massive swirling vortex, leading down.  The
current quickly grabs you and begins to suck you toward the center of the
spinning mass of water.  Spinning, you can't stop the spinning.  Faster and
faster toward the unknown, then you get sucked down into a tunnel and swiftly
carried away.

Rocky Beach~
Gone are the pristine white beaches you launched from earlier.  This
beach is covered with rocks of all type: small, large, dull and sharp, but
there is no beauty here.  The beach itself is rather wide although not long,
surrounded by large cliffs, which look impossible to climb.  A cave entrance
can be seen to the east, slightly hidden in the shadows of the cliffs
above.  The only life you see here is the occasional gull as it soars above
your head.

A Dark Entrance~
A long tunnel leads deep into the solid stone cliff, with the faint sound
of splashing water echoing down from the darkness.  A scratching of claws of
stone can be heard rushing toward your position, making your mind race about
retreating back toward to safety of the sea.  Maybe there is something of
great value hidden deep in the mountain, is it worth a look?

A loud snarling suddenly makes you stop in your tracks, as a something
moves among to shadows.  Your weak light does little to drive back the
darkness or your fears, as you stand there peering down the tunnel.  The
sound water rush water is getting closer as well, filling the area with a
relaxing yet un-nerving sound.

Edge of the Pit~
A deep pit lies before you, but the walls are very uneven giving you
ample foot holds should you wish to venture down into the darkness.  Peering
into the open space below, you can see the reflection of your light bouncing
back the pool of water covering the pit floor.  The pit is filled by a small
hole in the side of the wall, from which water rushes in, yet the pit never
overflows.  There must be a secret opening on the pit floor to allow extra
water to drain, maybe a secret treasure.

The Bottom of the Pit~
An eerie green glow seems to emanate from the pit floor and walls, which
are covered with a slimy yet harmless fungus.  A large dark mass does seem
to occupy the far area of the pit seems to pulsate as you approach, but does
not move toward you.  You do notice the lack of any opening in the floor or
walls, yet still the water levels never rises above a few feet.  You can
clamber back up the wall, if you tire of standing in ice-cold water.

Edge of a Plush Forest~
Small trees and colorful shrubs grow plentiful here, before leading deep
into a large forest.  Beyond the tree line shafts of sunlight reveal small
animals scurrying about and the large trucks of the trees, which seem to
reach the heaven they grow so tall.  Despite the cheerfulness of the scene,
a dark warning has been placed at the forest edge, a polished human skull
gleams a brilliant {Wwhite{x; warning all away.

Trail Though the Forest~
Tempting fate, you bravely press deeper into the forest.  As you wonder
deeper into the forest, you suddenly realize the trail you thought you were
following has vanished, and the only visible paths lead only east and west. 
A sudden snapping in the nearby bush, sends ripples down your spine, making
you wonder in entering this forest was a nice idea.  Glancing carefully at
the ground, you notice the path-leading west has many more footprints, maybe
a place of safety.

A Path Deep in the Forest~
Having completely lost your sense of direction, you wander aimlessly down
the path.  Off in the distance a faint rumbling can be heard as if a great
waterfall if crash over rocks.  A small animal stares at you from a nearby
tree, but disappears as you glare at it.  A small pond can be seen off to
the east, inviting you to dive in and take a swim.

A Secluded Pond~
Sparkling clear water fills the large pond that is feed from a thundering
waterfall to the north.  A bright rainbow has been created from the water
vapors of the waterfall, arching over the entire pond.  Small fish dart
around the pool while in the center a small island has a lone tree growing
from it.  If you have a boat, you could travel toward the waterfall or else
you must head back west into the forest.

The Thundering Waterfall~
The sound of the waterfall is deafening, making it impossible to speak or
hear most anything.  As the water comes crashing into the pond the mist
fills the air, making seem as if a light rain is falling.  A small dark area
can be seen beyond the wall of falling water, although he can not see an
easy path to get past the falls, without getting really wet.  It appears
this was a dead end, with the only path leading back into the forest to the
south.

Behind the Waterfall~
A small passageway leads down into the bedrock, leaving behind the bright
and cheerful feelings of the surface.  An uneasy feeling overcomes as you
stare down the dark hole, as you wonder what could be lucking in the shadows
for you.  Although not steep, the passage is slick from the waterfall, as it
sometimes splashes down the passage, creating a mini-stream that rushes into
the darkness.

Deeper into the Bedrock~
The small passage continues to slope further into the earth and the air
begins to develop a slight chill to it.  Peering down you think you can see
the bottom of the shaft, which then leads south into another tunnel which
you can not really see from this position.  A faint blue smoke seems to
drift up from the bottom of the passage, which is strange since you feel no
heat from further below.

Bottom of the Shaft~
At long last you reach the bottom of the passage, only to find yet
another one leading south as you suspected.  A soft whispering sound can be
heard, but it lacks the pitch of a voice, yet calms your nerves.  The blue
mist seems to flow from the south in a slow but steady stream; and has a
faint oak scent to it.  Even though there is smoke, you fail to see any form
of light that would indicate a fire; maybe you should play it safe and climb
back up to the surface.

As you push further south, the mist starts to thicken but does not hinder
your breath or sight in any way.  The rock here seems more worked and
slightly polished then the natural bedrock of the passageway down.  Along
the floor, small, almost worthless gems sparkle throwing multiples colors
along the walls from your torch light.  Suddenly, you hear a scratching
noise to the south, as if something was moving along the rock floor.

You have discovered the secret temple of the jungle people.  The large
cavern is filled with piles of bones all appearing to be human, or at least
humanoid, with each pile topped with a large grinning skull.  A large stone
altar hovers above a large pit that seems to lead into hell itself, with
large flames spewing out of it.  A strange figure seems to appear out of
nowhere, only to vanish as you try and focus on it.

in the deep soil and the sound of snapping twigs around you are a reminder
you are not alone.  Several smaller paths seem to wander off the main trail,
only to lead into a dead end or loop back onto the main trail.

fence surrounds the entire complex; more for looks rather then protection,
since cattle could most likely bring it down.  A few figures can be seen

lives.  Tall trees offer protection from attack from all but this lone
entrance into the village.

- A simple dirt path leads westward toward a massive wall of trees, which
acts as the one of the natural barriers for the village.  The sides of the
nearby building are north and south seem to contain sleeping halls.  At the
end of the road lie two more buildings, both which seem to glow from a
magical energy.  Strange chanting and bright flashes of light come from the
end of the road.

This deserted stretch of road seems eerily quiet, almost as if the dead

plant growth but there are large scorch marks scarring many places.  When
you attempt to enter the fields to further explore the damage, an invisible
shield forces you back onto the road.  You begin to think you should the
occupants of the houses alone, as they have some great power.

The road comes to a dead end at the tree line of the forest.  The air is
filled with so much magical energy, the hairs on the back of your neck stand
on end.  The building to the south has a warm glow while the northern
building pulsates with evil auras.  There is no life near the end of the
road, as if even the forest animals fear to tread near the powerful place of
magic.

An elegant marble fountain stands in the center of the square, although
is appears to be filled with a dark red substance instead of water.  Small
objects are floating in the liquid, you are not sure what.  Several benches
are placed in the square, for the citizens to sit and talk or enjoy the
afternoon sun.  The road splits off into each of the four cardinal
directions, all of which end at a dead-end save the southern route out of
town.

Altar~
A black onyx altar stands at the end of the road.  The most recent
sacrifice still lies upon the altar, blood dripping off into small pools on
the ground.  A few members of the cult still linger nearby, chanting and
wobbling in place as if in a trance.  A slight glow surrounds the stone,
making it appear unearthly in origin.  A solid wall of tall oaks, block any
further movement beyond the altar.

Master Mages Residence~
A cluttered room filled with small magical objects and scrolls sit in
piles all over the many tables.  A ball of light hovers over the room,
following a stout little man around.  A small falcon is sitting on the
rafters and when is sees you, it squawks in warning.  A single window looks
out over the damaged field and the wall has many burn marks upon it.

Village Healers Residence~
You step into the cleanest house in the whole village.  A table about six
feet long sits in one corner and a small rank has a multitude of strange
instruments hanging from it.  A caring old woman greets you as you enter and
directs you toward a small chair, poking and prodding you as you move along.
The pleasant smell of lavender fills the air and helps soothe your nerves.

It seems many people share this one building.  It has only one room, but
is covered in soft furs and blankets.  In one corner a large table sits,
still covered in food from prior meals.  A few large lumps in the covers
lead you to think some members may be sleep, might be best not to wake them.
The room has a warm feel to it, although no fire burns within the walls.

Edge of a Massive Desert~
Golden sand turns from the brush of the forest, stretching as far as the
eye can see to the west.  Although the dunes are forever shifting with the
winds, a small path seems to be visible, slightly glowing, beneath the top
layer of the loose sand.  A small lizard scampers across the burning ground,
seeking shelter in his home under the shade of a small spiky tree.

occasional small bush or spiky tree, there is nothing but sand in all
directions.

the thirst for waters surfaces.  The air shimmers from the heat rising from

The closer the oasis seems to get, the less it seems to exist.  After

was merely a mirage, created by the heat and the intense desire for water. 
Luckily the path is still visible, which turns back westward leading up over
a tall sand dune.

around, nibbling at the grass surrounding the pits.  All the area seems to
blend together, a sea of grass and shrubs filled with black spots of death.

disorination and confusion.  The dark color and lack of life within this
area of the beast makes the mood mudane and starts to dull the senses.  The
passages twists off to the east ahead or you can backtrack to the south.

Damp Tunnel~
The tunnel seems to be getting more humid the further along you travel. 
There is also the distant crashing of waves echoing down the passageway. 
Maybe you are getting close to an exit from this beast, hopefully not your
own death in thr process.

Fungus Filled Cavern~
The passage opens into a large cavern covered with a dark pus-filled
fungus growths scattered over the walls.  Some of the growths seem to
pulsate while others drip nasty globs of liquid on the ground.  A small
tunnel leads west while a larger passage continues northward.

A Nasty Infection~
The passage is filled with a large nasty and very inflected mass of
flesh, must be from an old battle wound.  The infected area is bright red
and rather inflamed; it writhes in agnoy when you step upon it.  There is no
way to continue to the west, so you will have to return eastward and try a
differant route.

Nearing the Surface~
The passage starts to smell less of death and a faint salty odor can be
detected.  The walls start to turn from red to a pink-clear color and they
allow a small amount of light to pass through them; although not enough to
see much.  To the north you can just make out an opening in the wall, which
this passage dead-ends about four hundred feet or so ahead.

A Bright Opening~
A thin flexable membrane seperates you from the freedom you so desire. 
You can smell the salt air and the slashing of water upon the body of the
great sea beast.  The membrane is slightly sticky but you can break through
if you push hard enough; although the beast may not enjoy it very much.  If
you wish to try and find another way out, you can travel back to the south
and see if you missed any other passages.

Chaos Wedding Chapel~
You are standing in front of a {Ddark{x temple altar, which is etched with
the symbol of the Chaos clan.  Small {Rred{x candles burn with a weird flame
which reveals an unholy priest standing behind the altar, ready to give the
blessings to the young couple.  In the corner, you notice a table filled
with food and some rulers wanna-be's to feast upon.  The room seems filled
with an unholy light and you spot demons everywhere preventing those of pure
heart from showing their faces.  Behind the altar you also spot a gigantic
statue of the mighty goddess of Chaos, Shaelindra, ShimoHouka no Teshi.

Foyer of the Great Church~
Tall marble pillars line the other walls, narrowing the passage toward a
great oak door.  Music and laughter can be heard coming from the other side.
Candles glow brightly and fill the area with a glow that seems to lift you
mood and sprirt.  The closer to the door you go, the more you feel in touch
with the inner power that seems to pulse within you.
