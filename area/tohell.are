This massive red skinned brute is the Lord of this place.
Mephistopheles is here sitting alone on a cliff. His pose 
is unbalanced: his bent right leg is raised and pressed 
to his chest and his left leg rests on his right foot. The 
head of Mephistopheles rests on the thin and elongated fingers
lying on his knee. This sorrowful and weary-faced figure 
hunched into a ball is thin with sharply protruding
collarbones and clenched toes and is full of tension and 
power. The angular beard protrudes from an emaciated
face. His hands and joints show signs of what appears to be
arthritis. The  body of Mephistopheles is the image of death.

sword~
The blade of the sword is a full meter long and straight as an arrow, with
lightly-fluted sides.  Both edges are keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp.  Perfection like this could have only been forged by a god.  The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
                      Vengeance is his who casts the blade
                      Yet he will in the end no triumph see.

{REntrance to Hell{z~
The temperature has risen slightly from the {ccool{x damp halls that you were 
traveling in. You have the distinct feeling that this place is {mE{Mv{mi{ML{x.
The walls are actually made of brimstone and continue on to the west. Distant 
screams can be heard from the other side of the arch. You notice a bronze 
plaque above the stone archway that is the "Entrance to Hell"{x.

Through me you pass into eternal pain:         
Through me among the people lost for aye.      
Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:
To rear me was the task of power divine,
Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.
Before me things create were none, save things
Eternal, and eternal I endure.
All hope abandon ye who enter here.
Such characters in colour dim I mark'd
Over a portal's lofty arch inscrib'd:

This corridor is dark and {ysulfurous{x. The smell of rotten eggs pervades. 
you cover your mouth and wretch. No race that you know of could live
here. This provides small consolation as there is more dead that alive
in these parts. To the west is some sort of shrine, and a stairwell leads
down towards the heat that is becoming something of a problem.

You are standing at the bottom of a stairwell that is oddly chilling in this
heat. The smells of brimstoneand sulfur continue to choke you. The screaming 
is becoming louder and the airhotter. Breathlessly you must decide if you 
should continue. Stone faces carved into the walls seem to laugh at you. 
Off to the west an imposing gate can be seen. This is where the adventure
begins. Maybe this is not such a good idea after all....

Before you is a blackened gate. The material seems to be steely, but you
are not sure of even that. What you do know is there are scratchmarks on
the inside. People are trying to get out of here, not in. The gate is open,
and you can freely walk in. Getting out seems to be the problem. The walls
of the room are made from the same brimstone that is characterisic of what 
you have seen before. On the other side of the gate staring at you with glee
are some stone golems. Again aren't guards supposed to be on the outside of

not even started but they know what awaits with the understanding
that only the dead have. The ceiling is clouded by the smoke that
seems to be rising from the very floor itself. Charcoal cracks
under your feet, and the dead wail.

Sloth is the desire for ease, even at the expense of doing the 
known will of God. Whatever we do in life requires effort. 
Everything we do is to be a means of salvation. The slothful 
person is unwilling to do what God wants because of the effort 
it takes to do it. Sloth becomes a sin when it slows down and 
even brings to a halt the energy we must expend in using the
means to salvation.

Overweening pride, arrogance, haughtiness: these have been 
the stuff of tragedy. Vanity, fussiness, delicacy: the stuff 
of comedy. These are all forms of self-delusion, and paper-thin
masks over rotting features. Pride and vanity refuse the truth
about who we are and substitute illusions for reality. While 
vanity is mostly concerned with appearance, pride is based in 
a real desire to be God, at least in one's own circle.

Gluttony~
Wise temperance of the stomach is a door to all the virtues. 
Restrain the stomach, and you will enter Paradise. But if you 
please and pamper your stomach, you will hurl yourself over 
the precipice of bodily impurity, into the fire of wrath and fury, 
you will coarsen and darken your mind, and in this way you will 
ruin your powers of attention and self-control, your sobriety 
and vigilance. This is the temptation of Gluttony.

This is a very small bedroom indeed, especially for the
amount of people trapped in here fornicating. The writhing
mass of naked flesh writhes and trembles with pleasure.
Pleasure turns to pain, and the bodies join and come apart.
You cannot tell one face from the next. Male and female
does not matter. This is lust. Lust turns pleasure into
pain and removes all joy in the act of lovemaking. You find
youself abhorred by the purtid smell that fills this room, 
and yearn for some more sulfur and brimstone.

an assortment of skeletons.  All seem to have been dead for a very long

burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of

This is the private chambers of the High Judge of Hell. He has a cushy job
and his office reflects that. Golden torches light the walls with dancing
blue and yellow flames. The judge's black crystal desk sparkles in the 
torchlight.

Stanley's Magical Steeds~
This is the shop of Stanly. He used to be an old mage selling cursed
trinkets at the town of Solace. He has recently set up shop in Hell selling
magical figurines. Each figurine is in the shape of some sort of steed.
Some are recognizable and some are not. Rumor has it that Stanley made
a deal with a devil....so I guess his lease is up in seven years.....

A Desert~
The door swings shut behind you and when you turn aroudn it is gone.
A vast expanse of desert lanscape surrounds you. The sand all around you whips
up when the wind blows. The heat is bareable. Nothing compared to what you 
have seen on your trip here. There are no sand dunes, only the flatness
of a plain of sand.
 
To the south you can see a cliff jutting out from the sand.
To the west you can see a building of some sort.

Feces and urine makes walking through the room treacherous. The smell of
wet fur is almost overpowering that of the excrement. That is not the big

You are standing on the inside of the reactor core. Actually you seem to

get here. You cannot proceed any farther, the only
