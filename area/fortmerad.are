You are following a tree lined path through the forest.  The forest is
impenetrable on either side, and the path shows signs that it is well
maintained.  The Forest is composed primarily of pine trees with a few great
oaks scattered throughout.  The treetops above you look lush with life, and
the forest looks very healthy.  The path continues north.

Abandoned Guard Post~
The guard post is composed of minor fortifications only.  A wooden
pallisade surrounds a small lookout post.  The entrance to the guardpost is
on the north side, away from the pathway it is supposed to defend.  The post
looks as though it was left in a hurry.  Plates are left on the table, and
there are personal effects scattered around the inside.  The path turns east
here.

A {gForest{x Grove~
A circle of trees line this grove and protect it from the inhabitants of
the forest.  There is a fire ring in the center to protect the woodlands
from the hungry flames.  You are confidant that this is a good place to
rest.  The cover is good, the dirt is soft, and the shelter of the trees
provide a break from the elements.

A Fortified Gate~
Built with large timbers, this gate is hanging from a hinge.  The
defenders did not abandon this post, they fought it out.  There is evidence
of a battle that lasted quite some time.  There are arrows sticking out of
the fortifications and there are claw marks everywhere.  The tracks look to
be from some sort of animal.  The gate, after a good push, opens and the path
continues north.

Inside the Fortified Gate~
There are no bodies around but the signs of battle are everywhere.  Blood
however is noticably absent.  Surely some blood was spilled here.  There are
various types of broken weapons scattered about.  In the distance you can
hear the beating of massive war drums.  To the north is a vast plain
surrounding a great city.

The Seige Plains~
This is a vast plain surrounding the Fortress of Merdriel.  There are
broken weapons scattered around you, and the sounds of battle are coming
from the east.  The beat of the war drums is disheartening.  The stench of
burned flesh mixes with the smell of death.  Looming above the fortress is a
{wBlack Sphere{x blocking out the sun.  
 
To the south is a Fortified Gate, which protects the solitary path into
these plains.

The Seige Plains~
This is a vast plain surrounding the Fortress of Merdriel.  There are
broken weapons scattered around you, and the sounds of battle are coming
from the east.  The beat of the war drums is disheartening.  The stench of
burned flesh mixes with the smell of death.  Looming above the fortress is a
{wBlack Sphere{x blocking out the sun.

Before the Cobblestone Path~
Before you lay vistas of splendor and beauty.  Through the a{ci{xr, the
mighty winged creatures of past and present, dragons, dominate the s{ck{xi{ce{xs,
playing peacefully.  From time to time in the distances, flashes of bright
{Bblues{x, {Ggreens{x, {Yyellows{x, and {Rreds{x can be seen followed by a loud, {Yt{Dh{Yu{Dn{Yd{De{Yr{Do{Yu{Ds{x
crash of noise.  Closer to the {ge{ya{gr{yt{gh{x, {gtrees{x of all sorts can be seen
blossoming before your very existence.  A {Yyellow{x cottage, trimmed in {Dwhite{x,
rests at the end of this cobblestone path.  {WN{xy{Wm{xp{Wh{xs, {Yp{yi{Yx{yi{Ye{ys{x, {Gd{Yr{Gy{Ya{Gd{Ys{x, {mf{Ma{mi{Mr{mi{Me{ms{x,
{ybrownies{x, and {gs{xp{gr{xi{gt{xe{gs{x can be seen frolicking gaily on the {Ge{gmeral{Gd{x {ggreen{x
grass of the well kept lawn.  All about you, creatures of all sorts can be
found.  Here and there, the alluring scent of fresh, ripe fruit can be smelt
faintly on the warm b{cr{xe{ce{xze.  The sound of trickling {Bw{ba{Bt{be{Br{x can be heard
faintly not too far away.  A bridge connects to the beginning of the
cobblestone path.  The sweet sound of laughter can be heard coming from the
open cottage windows.  A {Dwhite{x picket fence is the only thing that appears
to be keeping you from what just might be your pleasant stay in this little
slice of {Ch{ce{Ca{cv{Ce{cn{x.

The {ybridge{x that arcs over the {Bs{ct{Br{ce{Ba{cm{x of {Bw{ba{Bt{Be{br{x below you is made up of the
same cobblestone that the following path with made of.  {MBaby{x dragons swoop
down and dance playfully overhead as {Yp{yi{Yx{yi{Ye{ys{x and {Wn{xy{Wm{xp{Wh{xs prance about giggling
at each other as they play hide and seek.  The potent scent of fresh, ripe
fruit is now accompanied by the scent of ever-blooming roses.  Entrapping
voices and the occasional enchanting laughter is still heard coming from
within the cottage.  The {Bs{ct{Br{ce{Ba{cm{x, trickling louder than before, can be seen,
bubbling under the bridge.  {BEl{Gem{Ren{Yta{Mls{x of all sorts dance wildly around you
in a ballad of gaiety and amusement.  Just beyond the {ybridge{x, to the left,
benches and chairs made out of all sorts of materials can be seen, awaiting
company.  Off to the right, a large, {go{ya{gk{x gazebo can be seen, shading its
occupants from the light in the s{Yk{xy.  The bright flashes of {Bblues{x, {Ggreens{x,
{Yyellows{x, and {Rreds{x can still be seen and the {Yt{Dh{Yu{Dn{Yd{De{Yr{Do{Yu{Ds{x noises can still be
heard.

This tent houses the second in command of the vampire's army.  The
hide-like material it is comprised of is not from any woodland or pasture
creature that you know of.  It is quite possible that it is human skin. 
Scrawled in blood on the outside of the tent are some unintelligible words,
possibly of magical origin.

Inside this magnificent structure you can see that even more pictures of
{Ca{cn{Cg{ce{Cl{cs{x have been carved into its {gw{yo{go{yd{x.  Great care and many years have been

are stoically waiting for the approaching marauders to attack.  Each arrow
their archers shoot is almost wasted on the undead flesh of their enemies. 
The vampires are biding their time and waiting for some unknown event to
transpire before assaulting the gate.

does not help your climb.

The Path of The {YSun{x~
This street is lined with tall lampposts topped with golden icons
depicting the sun.  The icons are enchanted to give off a dim glow, lighting
the street around you.  The cobblestones have been painted gold, and are
tiled in concentric circles.  Not many people are traveling however, and the
city is quite quiet.  There is the occasional barking of orders in the
distance, but otherwise silence reigns, save for the beating of the wardrums
from outside the wall.

{MM{me{Mr{ma{Md{mr{Mi{me{Ml{x Towne Square~
This is the Grand Square of the Fortress of {MM{me{Mr{ma{Md{mr{Mi{me{Ml{x.  There are four
pillars around you, which support the colossal tower above.  The pillars are
made of marble, and they are etched with runes of many types.  The runes
seem to glow in the gray darkness that covers the city.  The square is
almost deserted as the citizens huddle in the homes to protect them from the
advancing army of evil.

The {wPawn{x Shop~
The shop is dingy, and the inventory varied.  Hanging from the walls, on
top of tables, and just laying on the floor are tons of worthless pieces of
junk.  Wherever there is space, something covers it, wheter it is stacks of
docuemnts or weapons and armor, you get the feeling that anything can be
bought here.  Shadowy deeds and hot deals abound.

This beautiful cafe, specialising in desserts is decked out in
avant-garde decor.  The tables are a beautiful beaten tin, roughly hammered,
and left nicely flawed.  Patrons sit around sipping capuccino and coffee as
they discuss the troubles that plague the town.  It is odd that the
atmosphere is so non-chalant considering the army of darkess that sits
outside.  Maybe the walls will hold.

Ezakail's Tavern~
The tavern is almost filled to capacity with the less reputable
townspeople trying to drink away their fear or imbibe liquid {Bcourage{x.  The
air is thick with hushed conversation and murmers of the evil horde
gathering outside the walls.  The tables are made of some sort of molded
rock, and the chairs of iron, both are stained and it looks as if they
havent been wiped in years.  The floor is sprinkled with sawdust to catch
falling ale.

The Barroom of Ezakail's Tavern~
This dark, {wseedy{x bar is frequented by the locals who seem not to care
about the cleanliness.  A perfect place for discreet talking, the booths are
enclosed by alcoves hiding faces and muffling voices.  Although Ezekiel, a
massive Rockseer is very formidable, he doesn't look very concerned about
who patronizes his establishment, except in fact that they do.  On the wall
to the south is scribbled on some {yparchment{x the rules of the bar.

is barely enough room for merchants to pass through with a wagon.  Puddles

The gate itself is in the form of a shield, massive in stature, it
obstructs all who would bash their way though.  The shield is etched in
runes, cryptically communicating the powerful enchantments on it.  The
shield is split down the middle where it can open as double-doors, and the
hinges are of the same obsidian as the walls.  Guards protect the entrance
with their lives.

the major piece, her desk, which is the centerpiece of the room.  Documents
are stacked neatly in order, and a map of the city is spread open on the
desk.  The walls are tastefully bare, save for a single portrait of the

itself is cut flawlessly, and was used for the walls, ceiling, and floors of
the tower.  You cannot see through the tower as the crystal is not
transparent enough for that, but in better times, the sunlight flowing
through this structure must create a thing of pure beauty.

The Vestibule of Atum'Ra ~
This is the minor entryway to the temple of the Sun God, Atum'Ra.  The
walls are marble, as are the pillars which have scrollwork at the top and
bottom.  The floor is worn from the footsteps of pilgrims making their
regular treck here.  Various depictions of the sun at dawn, at noon, and at
sunset are etched into the floor tiles.  The temple continues north.

The Path of The {YSun{x~
This street is lined with tall lampposts topped with golden icons
depicting the sun.  The icons are enchanted to give off a dim glow, lighting
the street around you.  The cobblestones have been painted gold, and are
tiled in concentric circles.  Not many people are traveling however, and the
city is quite quiet.  There is the occasional barking of orders in the
distance, but otherwise silence reigns, save for the beating of the wardrums
from outside the wall.

The Guard Barracks~
This is the barracks of the defenders of the fortress, the place is
almost deserted as most are positioned on the wall to defend them.  Weapons
line the walls of the room, and various types of armor are on a table in the
east corner of the room.  There is a large scrap of paper nailed to the
north wall which details the plans of defence for the fortress.

Officer's Quarters~
This room is spartan in its lack of personal effects, however everything
seems to be well made, and adequate to provide the necessities of life as
well as some measure of comfort.  Beds are made and the tabletops are clean.
Each living space is kept exactly like the other in true military fashion. 
One item is out of place here however, a small {Ygold{x medallion lies on
top of one nightstands.

General Izenrog's Quarters~
The general's quarters are only distinguishable from the officers in that
the quality of the furniture is better, and there are some minor personal
effects laying around.  A sword hangs above the single bed, and is
reminicent of some trophy won on the field of battle.  Each wall has maps
and charts of the city dominating them.

The Fortress Magik Shop~
Scores of spell components are organized and labeled on the shelves which
line the walls on the east and west side of the shop.  Behind the counter,
are more rare items.  Most notably, what looks like a very large claw,
possibly from a dragon, is hanging behind the counter.  Wings from some sort
of flying creature hang limp from a hook.  The smell from some sort of
preservative pervades the room, and you are not sure which items are
trinkets for the small minded, and which are true items of power.

An Imposing Looking Cloud~
You are on the fringe of a dense cloudcover that has somehow drifted
down to the ground. It is not all that astonishing considering the
fact that the sun is currently blocked by a large {wBlack Sphere{x. The
mist that surrounds you is cool and damp, there is a large amount of
static electricity building as your hair is starting to stand on end.
You believe you can continue through the cloud to the west.

The Undead Command Post~
What once was lush ground has been trod down by the souless feet of the
undead.  The earth itself seems to die at their touch.  Eerie silence
pervades, and the whispers of souls trapped into service utter
unintelligable pleas.  Calls from the walls of the defenders fortress reach
your ears as they prepare for battle.  Here though there is no reaction. 
The dark forces are awaiting their commands.
