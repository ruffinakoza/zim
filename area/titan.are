The Forest Changes~
The forest around you has changed rather dramatically.  The trees seem
more spread apart, and the the forest now consists mostly of gigantic pine
trees, their sharp green spires reaching to the clouds.  Ahead of you rises
the craggy maw of the Dragon's Head Mountains.  A path through the trees
continues to the northwest, moving up to run along the base of the
mountains, the path also leads off to the south.

Trail Through the Pines~
The trees seem to grow further apart, and instead of the small scrub
brush and dwarf conifers that you might expect to see in this type of
region, the trees are large and rather imposing.  The sweet, spice-like
scent of decaying pine needles and pitch fills the air.  A large black raven
wings slowly overhead, cawing raucously, but otherwise, all is quiet.  
The path that you are travelling continues both east and west.

A Clearing in the Woods~
Suddenly the path comes to an open section on the road. You realize that 
mountainous peaks stab sharply into the sky, creating a look of might, a look 
of power. Lush green plants can be found in all directions, speckled with the 
odd reds and yellows of the wild flowers. A small brook trickles alongside the
path, adding a harmonious tune with the soft whistle of the scarcely know Grey 
Bird. A soft mist whisps slowly past, cascading over the brook, creating 
a beautiful soft atmosphere. 
The path continues west and east.

A Steep Path Down-Hill~
The bright warm sunshine seems to lighten your heart, as you notice you 
have lost all sense of direction. The quaint small brook that followed you 
from the east, is slowly gaining speed. Mountains of all sizes tower up sky-
high above you, creating a wonderous view of the lands. The crisp cool air 
seems to add new strength to your sore old bones. The path continues west 
and back east.

Alongside A Wild Waterfall~
So much for a quaint little brook.  The what once was small brook is now
a raging waterfall, crashing and thumping against the rocks, as it
visciously works its way, still off to the north of your path.  You notice
the mountains seems to encase you in a valley, forever growing taller and
more mighty with every step.  A dark green moss seems to cover the trees
about you, camouflaging the wild animals of the woods.  It seems as though
these trees and plants are older than time itself, yet have never aged a
day.  The ground is covered with soft brown pine needles, matting your heavy
footsteps.  Several large boulders are scattered here and there throughout
the woods.  The path continues west and back east.

A Sharp Bend in the Road~
You come face to face with a mighty mountain wall, blocking your path. You 
feel like you have wasted all your time and effort just to get here, to find
a dead end. Right before you give up you notice a flicker of movement to your 
right. You turn, yet you see nothing. Suddenly you realize a small matted path 
curves around the mountain, almost like a deer trail. Perhaps you should 
follow it to see where it takes you. The path continues north, through the 
deer trail, and east, where you came from.

The Windy Deer Trail~
You are on a windy deer trail, which seems to wind this way and that. 
The sounds of the forest are all about you, blending together in a
harmonious song, with the wind in the trees as its melody.  The soft mist
swirling about your face seems to wet your boots as well, the droplets of
dew glistening like jewels.  Numerous spider webs grasp at your face and
clothes, a minor nuisance in such a beautiful environment.  Up ahead you
notice that the path widens as it leaves the forest.

to a loose gravel and begins to flatten out.  The massive wall of the
mountain suddenly looms up to your left, and up a head you notice that it
juts out, almost creating a dead end.  The path continues west and east.

At a Quaint Little Bridge~
The wall of the mountain juts out, blocking your path, but a quaint little
bridge lies a short way to the north.  It seems quite stable, and looks safe
to cross.  A beautiful brook trickles slowly underneath the small bridge,
creating a relaxing sound.  The forest seems to be more lush on the other
side of the brook.  The path continues north, across the bridge, or east,
back to the path.

On The Quaint Little Bridge~
As you cross the bridge, you can't help noticing the sturdiness of the
construction.  It is wide enough for two ox carts to travel across side by
side.  Hell... a giant could even walk across it!  Below, the silver and
quartz reflection of the sun upon the sluggishly moving water is a relaxing
sight.  A glistening rainbow trout jumps out of the water just under the
bridge, splashing you with fine droplets of water.

You have made it past the peaceful bridge and are now on a woodchip
covered trail.  The peaceful sounds of the Blue Birds and the joyous chatter
of the chickmunks add to the beauty of these lands.  The tall Oak and Mapple
are just some of the numerous trees you recognize.  Beautifully lush ferns
fill the gaps between trees; a little Red Juliefire sprouting out here and
there, giving the forest floor a wider variety of color and beauty.  In the
distance you hear the rushing of a waterfall, and the loud soulfull cry of
the Black Crane.  The path conintues west and back to the brige south, while
a faint trail leads north.

The Long Path Continues~
As you continue to walk down this glorious path, you notice that the sounds 
of the waterfall are getting louder and clearer. The sun plays shadow games 
with the wind through the trees, lightening your heart with joy. Deep in the 
bush you see a bright red Pinion bird, rare to all parts of the world save 
the most beautiful. The trees and plants seem to almost glow with peace.
This is such a beautiful place, you never wish to leave. A soft breeze lifts 
your hair and brings you the fresh scent of Golden Wildflowers, making you 
wish you were in a sunny field, rolling in them. But you still would much 
rather be here. The path continues west and east.

The Great Lookout~
You are standing about 300 feet above the raging rapids of The River of
Venus.  You realize that the trees did a great job concealing this massive
cliff.  Right beside you there is a massive raging waterfall that tumbles
down at a glorious speed.  It is amazing how powerful these falls are.  A
well crafted bridge swings the span of the cliff, right in front of the
waterfall.  You would hate to make a mistake and take a step off the bridge.

Still the white foam at the bottom looks as soft as clouds, and the speed of
the falls brings a cool, fresh breeze.  Just being this high up is so
exhilarating, you could stay here for ever!  The bridge continues south or

The Druid Lord's Secret Study~
You have stumbled into the most beautiful room you have ever seen! giant 
slabs of white marble with the accasional greyish streak through them cover 
every bit of the floor, save for the far south of this room, which has 
a gloryious carpet, telling the tales of several great battles, all woven 
into the magical design. Tall book shelves cover the eastern wall of this 
cavern; books of lore, magic, spells, ceremonies and much more. A giant
oak desk lies infront of the bookshelves, covered with paper and all of 
Xavier's work. A light blue chair rests in the northern corner. A thin line 
of glass-like whater cascades down the western opening creating a magical 
window. Etched in stone high above this wonderous site are the words 
'Mirror of The Worlds'. You gaze into the light white waters and see your 
past. Despite being inside a dark cave, this study seems to be quite 
comfortable. Several bright torches line the walls, and one giant blue flame 
floats magically in the top-most center of the cave. Magic just seems to flow 
through this cave, magic beyond your wildest wonders. You wonder where the 
exits are.

eagle soars on the calm winds overhead, scanning the waters below.  Your
stomach feels a little queasy and you can't wait to get off this bridge and
onto solid ground again.  A road lies to the south, the bridge continues to

Boy, it sure feels good to be back on hard, solid ground again.  Tulips
and rose bushes line the pathway, adding to the beauty of this strange land.
The tall trees seem to give enough shade to keep you from getting burned by
the hot sun.  Long and curvy.  The mountains loom even higher in the
distance than they ever The mountains loom even further in the distance than
ever before.  The land about you looks to be thousands of years old, its
surface torn and scarred by many earthquakes and storms.  The path continues

A Path To A Very Fancy House~
You are now walking on a stone walkway to a very fancy house.  Nicely
trimmed flowers and bushes lie in neatly tended patterns along the dark
green grass at the front of the house.  The house itself is huge and white. 
It appears to be two stories high, and it looks as though this house
belonged to a Lord, a Lady, or someone with a LOT of money.  You wonder who
would live in such an extravagant house.  The exits are east to the house,

You have entered the Front Foyer of the house and already you are staring
in awe.  It is amazing how beautiful this house really is.  Several
tapestries hang from the walls, and freshly cut flowers are in vases
everywhere.  Not a speck of dust is to be found.  A house like this must
have many maids and cleaning people to keep it so neat and tidy.  You do not
wish to intrude, so you might as well leave this house alone.  Your only

vast, beautiful island. Beautiful white bridges cross from six points to 
this village, adding to the glorious beauty. You are almost quite sure that 
there are more than one Inn on this island. You better hurry, they may be
closing these bridges soon.  The exits are east and south, to the village.

At The Bridge Gates~
You come up to the wondrous golden bridge gates to the City of the Titans.
Several guards are here, greeting travelers as they come. It is getting quite 
dark and you would rather be inside the city when night falls. You decided to 
head on up through the bridges, across to the island, protected by the long
water moat, and tall stone walls. The city looks to be as safe as any city 
could possibly get. The exits are south and north.

The Beginning of the Bridge~
You take your first step on the giant Bridges of the city.  Thousands of
people seem to be walking back and forth, talking to each other, meeting
friends doing business, heading in or out of the city, basically, keeping
quite busy.  The floor is covered in a light green carpet, rolled out
endlessly along the floor.  Crystal clear windows are along the side walls
and several torches light the ceiling above.  The smell of pitch burning
reminds you of your grandmothers cottage, in the early Winter.  The path
continues north and south.

the central city. You have never seen so many different races of people mixed 
together at once. It truely is wonderful to see so many races getting along 
with each other.  The road of the Bridges continues north and south.

You have finally reached the middle of the Bridge.  Everyone seems to be
going at the same pace, no-one seems to be in any hurry whatsoever.  You
notice that some of the people are dressed really well.  Infact, it seems as
though everyone is dress neatly.  You feel a little out of place, wearing
your travelling gear and battle armor.  Maybe in town you can buy yourself
some decent clothes, that is if they will accept your gold.  The path

hardly wait to find an inn with a nice, cozy bed and room.  A piping hot
meal wouldn't be bad either.  The bridge continues south to the town
entrance, and north, back to the center of the bridge.

Welcome to The City of The Titans! Many races are known and accepted 
here. This city consists of more people than Midgaard, Thalos and Ofcol 
put together! You wonder where the best Inn would be. It would be nice to 
kick off your hiking boots and sit down to a warm fire and a long, enjoyable
pipe. Better start looking for an Inn. The exits are west and east to the

large house line this Cul-De-Sac. To the south you see a large white house, 
set about 20 feet or so behind a large wooden fence. A well tended yard 
greets you with beauty in front of this house. To the east you see a large 
grocer. To the west there is an Apothecary. The exits are north to the 
side-streets, south the the yard of the house, east to the very large grocer 
and west to the Apothecary.

You have entered a very large wooden hut. Shelves of all sorts line 
the walls, filled with many different color and sized jars. To the north 
of this room you see a large wooden desc with a potion brewer mixing together 
a dark green and light yellow potions. Many runes and scrolls cover the walls, 
where there is not shelves. A white bear rug is under your feet, giving the 
room a strange appearance. The only exit is east to the Cul-De-Sac.

the gates with the random lily here and there. Large grey steps lead up to 
the front door. The house seems vacant; several winter pannels still not 
removed, the extra long grass in the yard, and the window that needs to be 
replaced are just some of the give-aways. The only exits is north, back

popular areas of the kingdome. A scattered shop here and there, several 
beggars lieing on the roads; cats rummaging through a pile of garbage near by. 
Even for the poor part of the city, in less common cities like New Thalos or 
Ofcol, this would be considered one of the richer parts of town. Grey stones 
pave the road and sidewalks. The exits are east to the Southern main road, 
west to the end of this road, north to a pub and south to a back alley.

of the city. You notice that several people are sitting around at the tables, 
laughing loudly, sining with the music, and having a really good time. You can 
see that half of them are patrol guards. A short and stuby little man is 
rushing around, making sure everyone has a mug full of beer. A large bar stands
over to your right, with several people sitting at the tables talking to each
other. You notice that there is a second room to your left. The exits are south

of the torches just a bit. You see to the north a stairwell leading into yet

On Top of The City Walls~
High above the clammer of the city, you find yourself on an outer wall. 
It seems as though the owner of the Pub managed to pursuade the queen into 
letting him use the top of the wall as a dinning lounge. Very few people are 
here but they do seem to be enjoying themselves. From this high up you can 
see the whole city with the monsterous castle towering above all the rest. 
You  notice that the city is on an island and right at the very bottom of 
the Valley. Beautiful green forests suround the outer walls, making it seem 
as though you are in a private heaven. There is a small dance floor to the 
east and the stairwell down.

you have ever come across, and you wish never to leave.  To the north you
see a quaint little container shop.  To the south is an old-fashioned
library.  To the west the road continues, and the east will take you back to

Upon lifting a great book on Titan lore, the bookcase opens in front of
you, leading into a secret passage.  You quickly scrambled in, with the
bookcase closing shut behind you.  Very dim torches light this stone
corridor, making it almost impossible to see.  It seems to be a dead end, or
at least it needs a key to get back into the library.  You wonder what
mysterious things lie ahead, where does the path lead to, where shall you
end up?  The only exits is west, and back north to the balcony.

surprises or letdowns.  Before you give up all hope, you notice a small
little door near the ground.  No, not a door but a grate leading out side! 
You bend down to get a closer look.  *sniff* The smell!  Garbage!  It leads
