The only painting that still can be made out here is a large oil painting
that hangs on the eastern wall.  It is a portrait of a very beautiful human
woman.  Her long black hair trails to the bottom of the painting where the
canvas has been torn away.  Around her neck is a small gold chain from which
hangs a diamond studded talisman.  The name Bethany is etched into the top
of the silver frame.

Entering the Sands of Sorrow~
Leaving the city behind, you stand on the verge of a great, swirling
desert.  These are known as the Sands of Sorrow.  You can't help but feel a
little despair looking southward into the vast arid wasteland.  Sandstorms
and endless dunes fill your path and make navigation very difficult, if not
impossible.

Dilapidated Checkpoint~
Here is what remains of a small guard shack and checkpoint.  It seems
there once was a road that led into a small city here, but the sand has
covered whatever lay beyond.  All that remains is this feeble building that
seems to stand out of sheer stubborness.  The desert has cleansed away all
other signs of this former civilization.

Sea of Sand~
The sand is churning beneath your feet.  The wind is so strong that the
floor of the desert has become more like a violent piece of sea.  Debris
flies through the air and stings as it bounces off your exposed skin.  You
think you see a building off to the west.  It's hard to be sure in the
blinding madness of the storm.

try to go north, but find your way blocked by a giant wall of sand that
crashes nearly on top of you.  The other directions seem to be more
passable.

Amidst the Dunes~
You trudge up and down the massive sand dunes.  Each hill you top seems
to be followed by one even greater in size.  It's as if some unseen force is
throwing successively harder obstacles in your path.  For a moment, you
think you hear laughter, but it quickly fades from your mind.

and bounced back off the tall rocks here, the dunes grow to enormous size.

sand.

Edge of the Bluff~
You stop at the edge of a steep cliff.  Looking out and down gives you a
new definition of the word nothing, because that is the only word that
describes what you see.  There appears to be some sort of structure to the
north.  It's impossible to make out what it is in the midst of the recurring
storms.

wind has shifted, and you are hit hard from the south.  The wind has reached
such velocity that, mixed with the flying sand, it prevents you from going
in that direction.

Sand is whirling all around you.  You sink a little into the dune you
stand on, before quickly regaining your footing.  Scanning around in all

elements.  You think you glimpse an oasis off to the east, or is it the
south?  Sand flying into your throat makes the idea of some fresh water and
shelter attractive.

You've come to a break in the swirling sands.  All around you, the storm
is still raging.  So, despite being out of the storm temporarily, your range
of vision is only slightly improved.  As the winds shift, you know you see a
small grove of trees, surrounding what you think is a pool of water.  Just
as quickly as you see it, the winds shift back.  Directions seem to slide
around the compass here.

The sands swirling around you let up slightly.  This temporary break

large oasis is to the south.  It seems a peaceful paradise compared to the
torments of the sand storm around you.

Remains of the Great Road~
A wide road spans forty feet across.  The wide highway is set with large
flat stones, each roughly the size of a full grown human man.  The stones
are smooth to the touch, and some have started to crumble away.  The wind
whips through and sends debris flying occassionally.  However, for the most
part, the elements are kept somewhat at bay.  This is due in large part to
the high stone walls on both sides of the road.

stone walls~
The walls look very strong and not too worse for wear.  They stand at a
height at least 10 feet taller than the largest giants you've come across. 
The walls aren't uniform and have given way to small cracks in them that
will surely mean their ruin soon.

The wide Great Road comes to an abrupt halt here.  The walls holding back
the torrents of sand seem to have given way.  Sand has completely engulfed
the rest of the road to the east.  A wagon wheel, a few ancient wooden
crates, and the skull of a horse are slightly uncovered in the sand nearby,
serving as a reminder of the pilgrims that once travelled this path

Now you see very clearly a lot of objects burning, you try to look at
them but the fire is so intense that you can't notice what it really is. 
Your fear raises in you and you feel like going crazy with all the fire
around you.  You think about memories that you had, dreams inside your head,
hunting you.  You see Death!

Entrance to Tainted (Lost)~
You have now exited Tainted Oasis through the western entrance.  You look
to the west and you can only see sand, black sand.  You try to see if
there's any water far away but your eyes can't see so far.  Try to adventure
yourself on the west sands, maybe you'll find something, maybe you won't.

The Gates to the Cemetary of Kharamul~
You are standing on a cobblestone path before a massive iron gate.  The
stones in the path are shiny and black.  This area seems very dark, as if
the air around you is filtering all light and dimming it.  The huge wrought
iron gate looks ancient but still very strong.  There is a chain looped
around the two sides of the gate to hold it together, but the lock on the
chain has been broken in half.  
A metal plaque is mounted on the iron gates.

The Black Rose Bushes~
You are standing among the rose bushes that run along the north side of
the cemetary.  The rose bushes, at first glance, appear to be dying.  There
are no leaves on the bushes.  They are just masses of thorns.  However, a
few black roses grow from each bush in spite of the plants' condition.  A
path leads beside the graves to the south.

The Black Rose Bushes~
You are standing among the rose bushes that run along the north side of
the cemetary.  The rose bushes, at first glance, appear to be dying.  There
are no leaves on the bushes.  They are just masses of thorns.  However, a
few black roses grow from each bush in spite of the plants' condition.

Beginning of Path~
You are standing a few steps inside an old cemetary.  A huge black,
wrought-iron gate is behind you to the north.  A mist rolls through the
cemetary grounds.  It seems to be perpetual night here.  Several tombstones
line the ground.  Near by, something or someone lets out a howl to the moon.
The path continues south, and row of bushes runs east and west.

footprints in the mud, ambling in all directions.  Cries of what could be
either pain or extasy fill the air.  That same short, dying grass lines the
path here as well.

A Grave Site~
A large ornate tombstone marks this grave.  The occupant of this site
must have been someone of great wealth or importance.  The ground here is
well tracked with footprints, but whoever left them seemed to avoid stepping
on the grave itself.  The muddy path continues on east and west between the
graves.

Wide Stone Path~
Obsidian colored stones line this wide, main path.  It divides the
cemetary in half.  A strong smell pervades the air.  It is a dank, musty
smell, the smell of decomposing leaves.  Screams and howls frequently ring
out here in this small world of perpetual night.  A small shack can be seen
off to the right, down a muddy path, and to the south you see a large
ominous structure.

ancient grave.  This place seems to be about death, not life.  A small,
plain stone marks this grave.  To the east you can make out a small shack.

that covers much of the ground in this place.

A Grave Site~
The overgrown path leads you by another of the many graves.  This grave
appears newer than the others.  The sickly grass hasn't yet started to grow
over the mounded earth.  A white alabaster stone marks this grave.

A Defiled Grave~
This plot has been dug up.  The simple wooden box that most likely served
as the occupant's casket has been pulled halfway out of the ground.  The lid
to the box is slightly ajar.  Upon closer inspection, the grave appears to
have been dug up from the inside out.  There is another of the stone markers
here.  This one has been overturned by the excavation and lies on its side
next to the casket.

drink up the moisture with an undying thirst.  There is no grass now, only
barren lifeless earth.  Just to the south, you see the eastern end of a long
line of great crypts.

The Small Crypt~
You are at the south-west corner of the cemetary.  There is a long
stretch of crypts that extend off to the east.  Before you is a small,
rather plain looking crypt, in relation to the others.  The stone door to
this structure has been torn from its ancient hinges and lies discarded to
the side of the entrance.

tall separates the stone walkway and the garden bed.  All the plants that

time probably worth a few thousand gold pieces, now it is faded and
tattered.  The moonlight streams in from above.  The roof of the mansion has

stone steps lead down to a smaller passage.

At the Bloody Door~
Standing on the west wall of the wide corridor is a tall obsidian door. 
It's edges are smooth and blend nearly seamlessly with the walls of the
hallway.  On the east wall is an etched gold plate.  The wailing is louder
here than in other parts of the hall, and seem to be eminating from the
door.

east gold plate~
This golden plate is written in a forgotten language.  The symbols used
are foreign to you.  Beside the lettering is carved a crow's head.  Someone
has written across the plate in blood the word {R'AKASHA'{x.  
~
E
symbol~
You examine the symbol closer.  It's meaning escapes you.  As you run
your fingers across the inlaid gold, a female voice enters your head.  
 
{r'Find the key, and I will reward you with my gift of eternity'{x
~
E
door~
A tall obsidian door stands here blocking your way west.  The door has a

The Hall of the Damned~
The obsidian walls in this hall seem to have turned from their natural
black to a dark crimson hue.  The wailing that is heard in the other parts
of the crypt seem to pick up some fervor here.  The sound of their cries
drowns out all else.  Torch holders on the wall are empty, and some have
even been torn off and cast aside on the floor.  Looking south, you see only
black, but are nonetheless drawn that direction.

The Hall of the Damned~
The obsidian walls in this hall seem to have turned from their natural
black to a dark crimson hue.  The wailing is joined by another more calming
sound here.  A soft voice seems to whisper in your head.  A wooden ladder
leads down into nothingness.  It seems sturdy enough for your weight, and
you feel a deep urge to investigate that black depth.

Deep in the Crypt~
You are about a hundred feet or so below the crimson hallway.  Here, deep
in the bowels of this cursed resting place, the walls are crumbling and are
marred with deep scratches.  The wailing has ceased, but an indiscernable
whisper fills your head.  It urges you to go further.

The Dark Sarcophagus~
This is the inner sanctum of the vampires that inhabit this place.  The
floor here is covered by a lavish rug that is covered in intricate patterns.
A set of stairs lead further down, for those who dare to go.  On the wall,
above the stairs, is an enormous painting of a very beautiful woman.

painting~
This must be the vampire queen, Akasha.  She is stunningly beautiful, but
something about the smile in the painting is off.  As you turn away from the
painting, you feel a short throb in your head, followed by a voice: 
 
{r'You're almost here, precious...
       The gift of Eternity awaits you.'{x

Akasha's Throne~
This is the lair of Akasha, Queen of the Vampires.  The walls are black
as a moonless night and emit a dull black glow.  In the center of the room
is a throne made of bones.  Draped over it is a red silk cloth which bears
the same symbol as the door that led to the back halls of the crypt.
