elf drow darkelf dark-elf guildmaster antipaladin anti-paladin~
the anti-paladin guildmaster~
A dark skinned elf is hunched over the table, eyes glowing red.
~
The guildmaster is completely absorbed in the ceremony that he is
performing.  A long flowing hooded cape covers most of his form, the little
of his skin that you can see is dark, almost black.  His red eyes glow with
excitement as he hovers over the corpse, muttering incantations.  You think
it wise to await the completion of his ritual, for disturbing him now could
bring disastrous results.

The Reception Area~
You are now standing in the reception of New Thalos. A huge mahogany
desk is here along with two sofas and a coffee table covered in magazines.
The plush carpeting under your feet is a nice change from the rugged paths
you are used to travelling. A chrome stairway spirals downstairs to the
tavern of the Dancing Daemon Inn, and your future adventures in New Thalos.

The Dancing Daemon Inn~
A huge circling wet-bar takes up most of the east end of the Daemon. An
old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
wall are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like
partying here.
The only obvious exit is to the north.

You are by the temple altar in the northern end of Temple of New
Thalos. A huge altar made of highly polished black onyx is standing
in front of you. Behind this altar sits a twelve foot tall statue of
Loki, the highest god in all the lands.

The Entrance to the Guild~
You are standing in the middle of a huge stone hall.  On each side of the
hall, a long row of ornately chiselled stone columns rise to the ceiling. 
Though the ceiling is far overhead, you can clearly make out the details in
the carving etched into the ceiling.  A holy knight kneeling down, head
bowed in prayer, his hands are clutching the pommel of his sword, point
downward in the shape of a cross.  At the end of the hall, a doorway opens
into the Paladin's training and prayer room.

Huge marble pillars rise on either side of you and grab hold of the ceiling.
Between each of these, fine softstone frescoes have been carved depicting
scenes from the religous history of New Thalos. Rows of pews face forward
giving their full attention to the pulpit rising high  above the ground. The
deep red carpeting underfoot shows not a speck of wear or dirt. It's obvious
that New Thalonians take religion seriously.

to the south.

for tonight's meal. Servants scurry about grabbing utensils and preparing
fresh hares. A small door leads out into the hall northward and the door

on your skin from the humidity here. All around you are thousands of
exotic plants and flowers. The sweet smell of jasmine and honeysuckle
reminds you of happier days at home. Off to the north, through the palm
trees, you see a delicate white gazebo. To your right stands a gold sign.
A path leads out into the hallway and west towards the gazebo.

Saska's Library~
Fine, golden dust swirls and then settles as you enter Saska's
library. Leatherbound volumes of Shakespeare rest next to paperbacks by
Tom Robbins, and Toni Morrison's _Sula_ is open on the striking table: an
antique birdbath of polished blond wood, with glass set over the waterwell
to give the appearance of a perfectly still pool.  Trinkets, lightly
lifted from the mantles of the wealthy whose chimneys she cleaned, line
the windowsills and create space between the different sections of books.
A crystal oil lamp seems to float on the table; a piece of paper on the
wall, written in Saska's own lingering script, reads: "For what is your friend
that you would seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to
live.  --Kahlil Gibran."
    A cat purrs somewhere, though you cannot see the source, and you feel
yourself tugged into the softened space. Have a seat in one of the enormous
papasan chairs, and choose a title that strikes you.

Ishtar River~
The river continues its descent down the lowlands flowing
ever so gently south. It's hard to believe this is the same river that
came cascading down the mountainside.

Small animals and herd animals can be heard in the distance, though
you don't actually see any near the river. Perhaps the steep slopes
pervent them from using the river.

A Dark Cove~
You have entered a dark, water-filled cove.  The winds rushing in from
the Dragon Sea to the west scream as they race downt he tunnel eastwards. 
The oily water laps rythmically against the walls of the tunnel, the noise
grating on your nerves.  You really wish you could make it stop.

A Dark Tunnel~
The dark water laps against the tunnel walls, and the wind shrieks in
from the west, howling and moaning like a lost soul.  The noise is beginning
to get inside your head, and you fancy that you see shadows flitting over
the water about you.  A bat chirps loudly as it flashes past your head,
startling you!  Growling angrily, you shake your fist at the shadows and try
to gather your draining sanity.

The Tunnel Bends~
The narrow water-filled tunnel curves off to the south, then east again. 
Though you are a long ways from the entrance to the cove, the crazed howl of
the winds seems to have intensified.  Your heart leaps into your throat as a
shadow detaches itself from the wall and lunges for you.  You feel the cold
embrace of the winds, but nothing more.  An illusion...  Nothing but a
damned hallucination!  
  Your minds screams at you "Get out now, before you lose ALL sanity."

for he recognizes a potential follower when he sees one.  He winks at you
and produces your purse from the folds of his cape and with a snicker
extends it towards you.  Your first lesson.  Never take your eyes off of a
thief!  He will teach you many more if you will mark his words carefully.

stench of rotting flesh, the smell of death, mixed with the pungent aroma of
incense.  Your flesh crawls and you wonder why you have entered this

torn open.  Staring hard into the gloom, you notice several other vaguely
humanoid shapes manacled to the walls.  A dull groan reaches your ears, and
a wicked smile crosses your face as your black heart revels in the agony and
suffering that you feel in this place.
