E
Dryad~
Dryads, being nomadic, free-spirited beings, have no organised habitats or
political structure, though small, independant communities of these magical
creatures have formed in the Sacred Grove and the Guild of the High Dryad.
~
E
Darkling~
Having only recently re-established contact with the other races of Anon
after centuries of isolation, there is little that can be said about this
race. Deviant Sidhe who fled the decimation of their surface kingdoms
centuries ago, what few that have made contact refuse to divulge anything
about their mysterious race or their political or social structure.
~
E
Avian~
No Avian settlements or systems of government are known, though it is
rumored that a great Avian city, ruled by an elected council, lies far to
the north of the Barony of Anon. However, no one has been there, and the
Avians decline to comment on the matter. The only other evidence of the
existence of this place is in Avian legend (see Avian History).
~
E
Illithid~
Only one city of the Illithids is currently known to exist, and it is located
in the great Psi Cavern, located far beneath the surface of Anon, in the
Underdark. The city is ruled in a feudal manner, with several orders of
nobility vying for power, all being dominated by the oldest and most powerful
nobles. Illithids have little to do with other races, save perhaps the Drow.
~
E
Kender~
The kender have only recently arrived on Anon, recently by the standards of
the other races, and are ruled by their chieftains in the city of Kendermore,
located near Solace. As can be expected, government is a random process in
the Kender society, as everyone pretty much does what they desire. The city
maintains a strong defense force, however, controlled and maintained by the
chieftains.
~
E
Dwarf~
The Dwarves of Anon are concentrated in one single kingdom, a remote, little-
travelled place known simply as the Dwarven Kingdoms. Their system of
Government is clan-based, with various clan chieftains taking turns ruling
the kingdoms. The holdings of the Dwarves once extended as far south as
lost Moria and as far west as the Northlands, but that was a long time ago.
Some consider the Dwarves to be a dying race, though it is best not to say
this within earshot of any Dwarves!
~
E
Drow~
The Drow, or Dark Elves, are an evil, aggressive race that live in cities
far beneath the surface of Anon. Only one is known by non-Drow, and it is
so secretive even its name is not known. It is ruled by several noble houses,
who are constantly battling to become First House, the house with the
most say. Women hold all the positions of political power, and control the
priesthood, which plays a vital role in Drow politics. This order answers
only to their cruel and evil demon deity Lloth.
~
E
Valley Elves~
The Valley of the Elves is inhabited by the aggressive, xenophobic Valley
Elves, who are ruled by a small tribal-style council. Much like their
sylvan cousins, their government is nominal, controlling mainly the
organisation of scouting and warrior parties.
~
E
Mirkwood~
This dark, mysterious wood is inhabited by a great number of Elves, most of
whom answer to the Wood Elf kings, in their great wooden estate in the
center of the forest. Government is indirect and erratic, however, the elves
really only coming together in times of great crisis.
~
E
Malathar~
The Duchy of Malathar was once one of the most powerful states on the planet.
However, they suffered serious losses in the wars with Humanity and Dwarfkind,
and now rule little territory outside the walls of ther impregnable fortress.
It is ruled by a hereditary succession of Dukes and Duchesses, though
government is heavily influenced by the mages and priests and their
respective orders. They are strong allies with the Barony of Anon, with
whom they trade via the River of Anon.
~
E
Elf~
The elven race is smaller in number than the Humans, though it is almost as
powerful. Its holdings consist of-

THE DUCHY OF MALATHAR
MIRKWOOD
THE VALLEY OF THE ELVES
THE CITY OF THE DROW

For more information, type READ MALATHAR, READ MIRKWOOD, etc.
~
E
Khellis~
The City of Khellis is surrounded by a thick, impenetrable marsh, inhabited
by savage swamp fiends who have reduced the once prosperous trade center to
near-ruin. It was ruled by the Warlords of Khellis, and their agents the
Constables, but both orders have long since vanished and the city now relies
on the guidance of their priests and veteran city guards. It is only a matter
of time before this city falls, which is a pity as it lies on the only road
that leads to the mysterious lands to the south east.
~
E
Alandra~
A once great city that has since succumbed to decay, the city of Alandra
controlled the lands now known as the Great Western Desert. Ruled by a
clan of Wizards, this Magiocracy fell victim to a disastrous magical
experiment that hurled it into another dimension, though it can still access
the lands it once ruled that the cataclysm turned into a wasteland. It is
now ruled in a manner by an elected Mayor, though he has little power.
~
E
White Lotus Temple~
The Temple of the White Lotus is a small militaristic order of Monks who
have a seperate community from the rest of Anon in their own right. The
temple is actually a fortress, well-defended by elite monks and warriors.
The holdings of the temple border on those of Midgaard and Solace, at the
base of the Ringing Mountains.
~
E
Camelot~
CAMELOT- A small but powerful state, the realm of Camelot lies to the south
of the Barony of Anon, and is ruled by the just and wise King Arthur and his
famous Knights of the Round Table. Camelot is on good terms with the Humans
of Anon as well as the Elves of the northlands.
~
E
Thalos~
NEW THALOS- New Thalos is what remains of Old Thalos, the most powerful
state of Anon's distant past. It has become overrun by dangerous monsters
such as the once-tame lamia pets of the ancient Thalosians, and mighty
beholders. It is rumored that great treasure remains there still.
~
E
Ofcol~
THE CITY OF OFCOL- The City of Ofcol rules over a large portion of the
northlands, bordering on the Dwarven Kingdoms. It is a theocracy, ruled by
an elite benevolent priesthood and its holy warriors. The people of Ofcol
are somewhat xenophobic, and have little to do with other races. The city
was constructed on the ruins of an ancient city populated by an unknown race,
and it is rumored relics from this age can still be found.
~
E
Solace~
THE CITY OF SOLACE- The territory of Solace covers both the city and the
surrounding lands, including Crystalmir Lake. The city is ruled by elected
officials, and a powerful military. The city has little to do with other
states, preferring to remain neutral.
~
E
Midgaard~
THE CITY OF MIDGAARD- The oldest city on the continent, the city of Midgaard
took its name for the native name of their home world, which they abandoned
in favor of Anon centuries ago. It is a nominal democracy, with the city
being ruled by elected officials such as the mayor and the constable. The
city was once powerful, but sustained serious losses in the kinstrife wars
and now has little control outside the bounds of the city.
~
E
Freeport~
THE CITY OF FREEPORT- A semi-democratic state- this port is a major trade
center, and controls a large portion of the Sea of Anon. The city is
responsible for maintaining order in this pirate-ridden region, a task it
isn't always very good at. The city is ruled by a council comprised of the
Admirals and chief merchants of the city, who are elected by members of
their respective followers- the navy and the powerful merchants' guild.
Corruption is rife in this organisation, with powerful pirate lords paying off
prominent members in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
~
E
Barony Anon~
THE BARONY OF ANON- The most powerful of the Human states, the majority of
this Barony takes the form of the City of Anon. Ruled by a long line of
Barons, the City is feudal in nature, though the head of the city is a
CAstellan who is appointed by the Baron from a list of candidates nominated
by the citizens of the Barony. This position is extremely important, as the
Castellan is responsible for the defense and well-being of the city, and
reports only to the Baron, who spends most of his time on his country estate
to the north of the city.
~
E
Human~
By far the most populous of the races, the Humans naturally have several
states. These are-

THE BARONY OF ANON                         NEW THALOS
THE CITY OF FREEPORT                       THE CITY OF OFCOL
THE CITY OF SOLACE                         CAMELOT
THE CITY OF MIDGAARD                       WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE
THE CITY OF ALANDRA                        THE CITY OF KHELLIS          

For more information, type READ CAMELOT, READ OFCOL, etc.
~
E
tome politics political structure~
THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF ANON-

Although the races of Anon now mingle in relative harmony, each of them still
has their own seperate states, most of these semi-independent city states.
The major staes of each race are listed in the relevant chapters. Type read
Human, Kender, Elf, Dwarf, Illithid, Dryad, Avian and Darkling  to read the
organisation of the relevant races.

Darkling~
At the time of the writing of this article, no single source was available
for any worthwhile comments on Darkling social structure. Indeed, since the
number of Darklings that have emerged into the world of Humanity can be
counted on two hands, it is impossible as yet to make any real conclusions.

It is known that the Darklings are deviant Sidhe who fled the destruction of
their feudal-style kingdoms centuries ago, but it is unknown what sort of
society they have formed in the Underdark, and whether they consort with the
other races of this realm. However, even the Illithids were surprised by their
emergence, so it seems unlikely.

It is also unknown why they have suddenly chosen to emerge, though this will
doubtless be made known in the years to come.
~
E
Dryad~
As Dryads rarely live together in communities it is difficult to assess
social classes or structure. Generally, all Dryads of both sexes are
considered equal. However, one can easily lose great status among fellow
Dryads by showing a lack of proper respect or love for nature.

Dryads that do live in communities usually have a central figure (always
female), who decides on the general activities of the group. A fine example
of this is the Dryad Grand Guildmistress's Tree, in the Woods of Insanity
(see Cochrane, X., "Life among the Dryads of the Beth's-es'N'Biririni").
Dryads actually place a higher value on the life and well-being of flora
and fauna than they do any sentient race, including their own.

Dryad males are extremely rare, and are not often seen outside the breeding
communities Dryads form every 7 years when they are fertile. Such males are
in general inferior to the females, though this is due more to lack of
proper training and experience rathr than any inherent flaw.
~
E
Illithid~
The single source of Illithid society comes from the Drow sorcerer Ree'faqx
Zaqxney's tome "The Social Structure of Illithid Society", of which only
fragments remain (the book was badly damaged during the Arch Mage Yaegar's
battle with this vile Necromancer). Even this lengthy tome gives only
the sketchiest details, which I shall attempt to summarise here.

Illithid society values mental power and stamina above all else, and those
who do not possess at least a competent level of mental prowess are considered
sub-illithid, and relegated to the status of peon. That aside, status in
Illithid society depends primarily on the status of one's clan, which can
fluctuate greatly. Clan warfare is not common as in Drow Society; this is
not to say it is non-existent (far from it!) but that conflicts are more
generally resolved through a system of bribes and blackmail rather than
armobed combat (physical and mental).

Few illithids will ever resort to performing menial tasks (to them, anything
that involves physical effort is too menial), as they have a large body of
mind-controlled slaves of several other races for this. In fact, one of the
gravest insults one can hurl at an Illithid is to insinuate he or she has
ever performed manual labor.

The sexes are equally represented at all levels in Illithid society, perhaps
more than in any other society, as physical prowess is irrelevant, and in
mental powers females can easily match (or surpass) males.
~
E
Avian~
Almost nothing is known among non-Avians about avian society. Besides the
common legends of their origin, little else has been discerned, as Avians
are a remarkably close-mouthed (or beaked) lot when around non-Avians.

It would be safe to generalise, however, that the ability to hunt, fly and
fight are considered of vital importance to one's social standing. In
addition, the lack of elderly Avians seen certainly seems to suggest a
very martial culture, where long life is rare due to constant combat.

It is known that Avians change greatly as they mature (see Afren, S. "The
Physiology of Avians" (Anon Press, 406 A.C), and that fully mature Avians are
considered the most important/powerful in any group of Avians. It is not
even known if there are Avians who do not eventually develop the observed
traits (Ibid., P.23), or if there are Avians who become so birdlike they
rise to positions of highest authority.

There seems to be an equal distribution of male and female avian adventurers,
though it shouldn't be construed that Avian society is free from sexual
discrimination per se.
~
E
Kender~
Kender communities are loose-knit, clan-style organisations, with everyone
possessing a more or less equal role in the community. Hunters also serve
as warriors, guards and even cooks and porters if the need arise, while
more learned kenders' tasks vary from education, spiritual duties, the
collection of knowledge and the overseeing of construction. Males and females
can be found performing any of the above tasks.

Kender communities place no special importance on any one kender, as all
contribute in their own particular way to the needs of society. One rather
unique aspect of Kender society, however, is their attitude towards
possessions. There is no real concept of personal possessions in Kender
society- they genuinely believe in the concept of taking whatever you want
from whoever. Kender houses are crammed with lots of interesting objects,
and most of them at one stage or another belonged to someone else. And while
Kenders have no problems with this philosophy, other races certainly do.
Kenders do not think of it as theft, and violently object to being referred
to as thieves.

Adventuring Kender can come from all walks of life, as most possess the
same skills, including the ability to move silently and quickly, and the
many skills needed to collect "stuff", i.e, picking locks and detecting
traps, as well as picking pockets. It is extremely hard to depress a kender,
their fun-loving nature and desire to explore is irrepressible.
~
E
Human~
It is extremely difficult to summarise human sociology, as there are as many
types of social structures as there are independant communities of humanity.
Generally, though, humans prefer vaguely deomcratic processes (they seem
to enoy electing their leaders), and prize the freedom of the individual
above all else, though they always knuckle under to the pressure of
authority.

Human society is very flexible, with upward and downward mobility usually
quite easy for those with enough power, money and ability. For example,
wealthy humans can buy their children places in mage or priest academies,
regardless of their offspring's aptitude, and a little money and a big stick
can allow even the lowest human to attain very high offices.

Adventuring humans are generally religous warriors, travelling worshippers of
Buddha who seek to spread the word of their god and crack a few skulls along
the way. Other humans have little desire to leave their environments, as
many still harbour old prejudices against the other races.

Sexism has been all but eliminated from Human society, after females
demonstrated during the race wars that they were more than capable of
casting spells and swinging swords as the males.
~
E
Dwarf~
Dwarven social structure is totally clan-based, with the social standing
of each Dwarf directly related to their clan. And while most clans have
members of many professions, certain clans favor mining and engineering,
such as the Chiselled Rune Clan, or fighting and exploration, such as the
Whirling Axe Clan.

Warriors hold the highest position in any clan, irrespective of focus. For
it is the warriors who defend the beleagured Dwarves from their many enemies.
The leader of each clan is generally the eldest and most experienced Dwarf.
Adventuring Dwarves are always warriors, as the other Dwarves, such as
healers, miners and bards, have little interest in such activities.

Female Dwarves are highly prized in Dwarven society, as they comprise only
about 20% of the race's numbers. And since Dwarves reproduce so infrequently,
they are often more guarded than even the Dwarves' precious minerals. Thus
female adventurers are much rarer than males, not due to any sexism but due
to simple numbers.
~
E
Elf~
The Elves of Anon vary in their social structure according to the various
sub-types of Elves. This chapter will focus on those Elves known as the
High or True Elves, the Elves that deign to associate with humanity, and
have a desire for adventure.

High Elves come from a very rigid social structure, a complex feudal system
where vertical ascension is very difficult. Basically, the path an Elf will
take in life is determined to a very large extent by what their parents did-
i.e, mages are the children of magicians, warriors the children of warriors,
nobles the children of nobility, etc. Occasionally, young Elves who
demonstrate an exceptional talent for a particular area, most particuarly
the priesthood, but sometimes the Magical Arts, will be taken from their
families and raised to become a member of that order. Other than that, an
Elves fate in their very long lives is determined by their birth. While this
may seem unfair to those used to a more flexible system, the Elves have no
problem with the glass ceiling.

There is perfect sexual equality in Elven society, though in general the
males favor areas such as the warrior or magic arts, and females prefer the
priesthood or healing arts. Adventuring Elves are most commonly those
interested in the magical arts, though many also have significant martial
experience.

E
Kender~
Of all the races on Anon, Kender are the least aggressive, but are inarguably
the most irritating. Their coming through the portals to the land of Anon is
said by most to be "an accident the Gods eternally regret", though usually
in jest. 

Kender are irritating due to their irrepressive urge to "borrow" items of
everybody and everything that comes their way, friend or foe, man or god.
They do not consider this to be theft, as they do intend to return the item
(but never seem to get round to it) and indeed to call a Kender a thief is a
grave insult indeed.

They care little for the affairs of other races, preferring instead to collect
as many strange, exciting or unusual objects as they can. Kenders are great
explorers, and a Kender can prove to be an invaluable guide when travelling
to uncharted lands.

They were not involved in the great war between the races that ravaged Anon
for decades, and thus share none of the prejudices that Humans, Dwarves and
Elves have acquired. They prefer instead to enjoy life, and they always 
manage to find something positive about every situation ( a classic example
is the fearless Kender Trich who, just before he was eaten by a dragon,
exclaimed- "Well, at least I won't have to repay that debt to Aod!".

Kender are on good terms with the Dryads, whom they are fascinated by (and
the Drayds are in return, greatly amused by the little people). They seldom
stay in the one place for too long, preferring instead to satisfy their
"Wanderlust".
~
E
Illithid~
Little is know of this mysterious race. They emerged only recently from their
deep underground lairs, and began to explore the surface world. No one knows
why they suddenly chose to end their self-imposed isolation, or what their
plans for the future are. It is not even known if the Illithids are indigenous
to Anon, or if they arrived like all the other races through portals.

Illithids are masters of Psionics, the powers of the mind. They have harnessed
this latent mental ability possessed by all sentient creatures, and use it
to great proficiency. They are incredibly jealous of their abilities, however,
and refuse to teach it to any non-illithid.

They have little dealings with other surface races, though explorers report 
that they are quite well-known in the depths of the Underdark, among Drow
and Svirfneblin, Kuo Toan and Darkling. A legend has sprung up that Illithid
feed upon the brains of other sentient creatures, extracting their brains 
from their heads while the victim still lives, and for this reason they are
sometimes called "Mind Flayers". Illithids of course deny this rumor
profusely, and say that it is a rumor perpetuated by their enemies, or that
only a very few, evil Illithids engage in this foul practice. 

The greatest bar to an Illithid's ability to interact with other races is its
hideous appearance (see below) and for this reason many shun the company of
other races. However, some Illithids have become significantly powerful
and respected to hold positions of importance in other communities.
~
E
Avian~
Avians are one of the only adventuring race indigenous to the land of Anon, or
at least partially indigenous. When the Immortals arrived in Anon, fleeing 
their homeworld, Lenny, their leader, met and became enamoured with a
beautiful human princess. Their relationship prospered, and Lenny planned
to make the princess his consort.

Then another, evil Immortal began to court the princess, a foul individual
named Hawk. He cast secret enchantments upon the princess, causing her to
scorn the affection of Lenny and favor instead the attentions of Hawk.
This reversal culminated one night in an attempt on Lenny's life by evil
assasins who claimed to be working for the family of the princess.

Lenny grew infuriated, and in his rage cast a horrid curse upon the princess
and her kingdom, causing them to mutate into half-bird creatures, saying that
"If the Princess was to court a Hawk, then she must needs be a Hawk too!" He
cast out the Immortal Hawk, who slunk away and established an evil domain
deep beneath the earth. 

Decades later the Avatar came across this cursed kingdom, and hearing their 
story, went to Lenny to object. Lenny was about to slay the Avatar for his 
impudence, when the Avatar (very hurriedly) explained that Hawk had used
magical enchantments to sway the love of his princess, who had long since
perished in anguish over her new form, and that she had always been true at
heart to him.

Lenny was devastated and went to remove the curse. But upon arriving at their
kingdom, the people, who now called themselves Avians, told him they were
happy with their new forms, and did not wish to return to humanoid form. Indeed
they thanked Lenny for his gift, for most were ignorant of the reasons for
their transformation, and the people now considered themselves beloved of
Lenny.
~
E
Human~
Humans are a young race, compared to Elf, Dwarf and Dryad, having come to
Anon much later than them. The Humans of Anon came from many different
worlds, as refugees, wanderers, explorers or fugitives. And, as Humans are 
wont to do, they quickly built towns and cities, and farmed the land, and
hunted the local animals, and they became quite comfortable in their new
home.

Kingdoms were established quickly, and just as quickly brought down by
rebellions, feuds, or war with their neighbors. Eventually a kind of stability
came into being, with individual city states (such as Anon, the largest,
and Midgaard, the first kingdom formed on Anon) establishing themselves 
domains independant of each other. 

Peace became even more advantageous when the Dwarves offered the hand of
friendship, and both sides soon prospered from a lucrative trade of the
Human-produced food and goods for the products of the Dwarven mines. Both
races enjoyed this situation, and soon a powerful aliance was formed.

It was never known who suggested war upon the Elves, or why it was suggested,
but it was, and both races eagerly agreed. For over thirty years, Humans
and Dwarves mercilessly assaulted the Elven kingdoms, reducing most of them
to ashes, along with much of the lush forests of eastern Anon. It was then
the Dryads stepped in, and negotiated a treaty to save their forests, and the
war was ended, though the prejudices remained.

Humans, no longer diverted by war, channeled their energies in other directions,
and begin to enhance the physical, mental and spiritual development of their
race. Academies were established far and wide to teach Humans this new school
of thought that had developed, the Martial Arts. Humans excelled at it, but
other races found it too difficult or boring, especially the Kender and the
Dwarves.

Now today, Humans are by far the most numerous of all races on Anon, and 
also one of the most powerful, thanks to their mastery of the Martial Arts.
~
E
Dwarf~
Dwarves were the second race to emerge into the land of Anon, after the
Elves. They quickly grew quite fond of this land, admiring the many tall,
powerful mountain ranges which to their added delight they found were rich
with valuable minerals. Soon Dwarven mines peppered every major mountain
range on the continent, and some Dwarves had even crossed the Salt Sea to
the New World in search of new ranges to mine.

Dwarves paid little attention to the affairs of other races, save the Elves
whom they kept a suspicious eye on, and the Kender, whom they banned upon
threat of war of coming near their hoards of gems and metals. They continued
to mine and smith, digging deep into the roots of the mountains of Anon,
and discovering many wonders (and evils- the Dwarves warred long against
tribes of Goblins who shared the mountain depths).

When Humans arrived, they formed a close bond with the prosperous Dwarves,
and an enduring alliance was forged that till this day remains unbroken by
either side. And while this alliance benefited both Humans and Dwarves, it
meant catastrophe for other races.

Dwarves had long hated and feared Elves and their magical ways, for Dwarves
detest magic, and Humans had been deeply jealous of the Elves' wealth and
power. So both races made was against the Elves, and nearly succeeded in
eradicating them. It was the intervention of the Dryads, who feared the
loss of their deep forests in the war, who stopped the war, and made the
Dwarves and Humans swear an oath to never again raise arms against any other
race, or to ever again wantonly destroy the forests of Anon, as they had
done during the war.

The Dwarves agreed, and withdrew to their mountains. Gradually they succumbed
to internal strife caused by boredom and isolation, and one by one the many
Dwarven kingdoms collapsed and disappeared. Only a very few remain today, and
they are but a shadow of the mighty kingdoms of their ancestors.
~
E
Darkling~
Very little is known of this reclusive race, save for what travellers to their
homeland or the rare Darkling adventurers have told. What is known is that
Darklings are descendants of one of the oldest indigenous races of Anon,
the magical, mysterious Sidhe.

Centuries ago, the Sidhe first encountered the new races to Anon, the Elves,
Humans and Dwarves. They fascinated these races with their rare, ethereal
beauty, as well as with their incredible magical abilities. However, the
fascination soon turned to greed, greed for Sidhe money from the Dwarves,
greed for Sidhe beauty from the Humans and greed for their magical power
from the Elves. Violence erupted, and the Sidhe were forced to flee, heading
deep beneath the surface, away from their beloved lands, where they soon
established a new civilization.

Their race became one at one with the dark and with dark places, so much so
that they all developed natural infravision, and their magic was adapted to
suit their new environment. For centuries they remained hidden, seperate
from all other races. Then younger Darklings, as they were now called, grew
curious as to what lay without, and many set off to become adventurers,
and thus contact with this race was regained.
~
E
Elf~
Aeons ago, when the land of Anon first came into being, Elves were among the
first races to emerge through the mystical portals that sprang up across the
continent, and they quickly established themselves a powerful and extensive
domain. They concentrated their settlements in the dense woodlands that then
covered most of Anon, or build beautiful crystal fortresses high in the
western mountains that seperate Anon from the Desert wastes.

Centuries passed, and gradually the Elves fell from dominance, losing interest
in the pursuit of power and wealth, and instead immersing themselves in the
study of the magical arts. Generations of such research eventually resulted
in the evolution of a race of Elves of which every member possessed latent
magical talent, the ability to shape and mold the magical energies which
flowed across Anon into whatever usage pleased them.

Thus eventually the Elves became renowned mages, and kings and princes of all
races sought them for their abilities, as well as their counsel, for Elves 
were counted among the wisest of all races, save the Dryad. And the Elves
prospered, and lived in realtive harmony with their neighbors.

Eventually, discord began to emerge, caused as is often the case by the
jealousy of the "lesser" races, and war between Elves and the other races
broke out. Combined armies of Dwarves and Humans drove Elves from their 
forests and their crystal palaces, at the cost of countless lives on both
sides, for the Elves did not surrender their lands easily.

This war raged for thirty years, until it was ended by the coming of the
Dryads, who were angered at the desecration of their beloved forests by Human
and Dwarf, and a peace was negotiated, for the mysterious dryads were greatly 
respected and feared. The races returned to their domains, and have since that
day maintained an uneasy truce, though in truth many members of the warring 
races still hold a deep hatred for the others. Some say the Elves' natural
arrogance and condescension to the "lesser" races brought about the war- 
others say it was the natural aggression of the Dwarves and Humans. Who is
to say?
~
E
Dryad~
Until very recently, the mysterious Dryads had lived apart from all other 
races, inhabiting secret glades in the deepest forests of Anon. They lived
simple, peaceful lives, attuning themselves to the majestic forces of nature,
and drawing magical energy from them that they could turn to any usage they
wished.

The Drayds were ruled by a wise and gentle immortal named Xanibdar, who had
come with them from their home world many centuries ago, stepping through
a portal to emerge in Anon. They had fled their own world, the name of which
has been forgotten, to escape war and enslavement, and on Anon they found
peace. For a time.

War broke out between Human, Dwarf and Elf, the cause of which was considered
trivial and immaterial to the spiritual Dryads, as was the (to them) petty
war itself. Then the Humans and Dwarves stormed the once-lush forests of
Anon, in search of Elves, and many thousands of acres of woodland was turned
to barren waste in their relentless march. The Dryads grew angry, and emerged
from their hidden realm, proving their existence to startled mortals who had
previously thought them to be legend.

Using their great powers and reputation, the Dryads brought the war to a halt,
a relatively easy task as the Humans and Dwarves were then still relatively
small in numbers and weak in magical skills. They did not do so out of
sympathy for the Elves, for the Elves had scorned the Dryads when they arrived
as if they were but simple primitives living wild in the forests. They did so
to preserve what was left of their sacred woodlands.

Since that day, Dryads have begun to interact with the races they once shunned,
and have found much to love in them, especially the Kender, of whom they are
exceedingly fond. Dryads are respected practitioners of the healing arts, as
well as respected wielders of powerful battle magics.

E
WEST~
The lands west of Anon are for the most part dry and arid, running to the
foothills of the Weeping Mountains. To the northwest lie the halfling
settlements of the Shire and Brandybuck, the history of which is well-known
by the Kender Pippin. Beyond these lie the Human cities of Midgaard and Solace
nestled in the rcoky foothills of the mountains.

To the southwest small Gnome settlements can be found, below the beginnings
of the more popular pass across the mountains, which leads to the lands of
Mahn Tor, and the western Ocean, across which lies the Gnomish capital of
Haven. It is rumored that air elementals and harpies imperil travellers
who stray too far in the mountains here.

The northern pass through the mountain, above Midgaard, runs past the Temple
of the White Lotus, to the sheer summit, where a more gentle path descends
to the river Myrdmuth, which runs into the Great Western Desert, a vast,
trackless waste which was once a fertile utopia, before the collapse of
Alandra. It is rumored that the ruins of the city can still be found there.

No one has yet travelled further west than this, so who knows what wonders
await?
~
E
EAST~
The areas to the east of the Barony are dominated by the vast Plains of Blood,
where no plant will grow or animal prosper, named for the blood that was
spilled there during both the Racewars and the Kinstrife wars. Past the
plains, one comes to an arid area covered with rocky hills, within which are
located several areas of interest.

To the south one will quickly come across the Graveyard where the dead from
the battles on the plains were laid to rest- it is rumored their cursed souls
still roam this place, as well as the ancient catacombs beneath the crypts.
The ancient Dwarven mine of Moria lies east of here, near the Troll dens.
Beyond this lies the swamplands, wherein can be found the ruined city of
Khellis, and the Old Marsh, where evil monsters have overrun the ruins of
an ancient civilization. Also in here, it is rumored, lies a gateway to
Hell.

To the north lies the cursed Ghost Town, where only the mightiest can hope to
travel and survive. East of there lies the spider forests, where ancient
arachnid evils await the unwary. Further east the road stretches, travelling
to the impenetrable mountains to the far east, a place the Fire Newts call
home. It is rumored that dragons reside near these rocky peaks as well, as
related by the Dragon-Slayer Dalamar.
~
E
SOUTH~
The lands of the south are dominated by vast mountain ranges and long
strtches of hills and small valleys. Among this vista is situated the famous
kingdom of Camelot, near the blasted ruins of the Dark Keep. These both
lie near the shores of the great Sea of Anon, which is ridden with pirates.
In the depths of this sea are rumored to lie two undersea cities- those of
Atlantis and Antharia. The massive port of Freeport lies on the southern
shores.

To the southwest can be found the ancient forest of Haon Dor. It is rumored
that the ruins of the city of Thalos can be found in here, as well as the
magical Happy Forest. South of Haon Dor lies the Elemental Canyon, near the
forest Murkmire, within which is located the human logging village of
Dunkeldorf.

Heading further south of here will eventually take one to the lands of the
Wyvern Tower, and the strange rock creatures and undead that live within.
Centaurs also reside in this area.
~
E
NORTH~
The vast majority of the lands north of the Barony of Anon is dominated by
the great northlands, vast, stretching plains that run from the Weeping
mountains to the west to the deep forests of the East that border on the
sea of Anon.

These plains are sparsely populated, sporting only the occasional druid or
animal, which wander the grassy fields with little danger. There are some
settlements in this area, including the City-state of Ofcol, and the
Dwarven Kingdoms far to the northeast. The legendary Werith's Wayhouse,
gathering place for adventurers from all over the world, also lies in this
area.

The great forests to the east are known by several names, though perhaps best
as Mirkwood, named so by the elves who first settled there. In the depths
of this forest can be found the elven duchy of Malathar, as well as the
sacred Valley of the Elves, and the Dryad Holy Grove. There is also a small
goblin kingdom further in the forest, where few dare travel. North of this
lies the magical world of Animaland, a small kingdom ruled and populated by
sentient animals and other strange beasts.

The cruel, evil Warlock resides in the forbidding peak of Firetop mountain
on the northern border of Animaland, sharing his domain with the vile lich
Ciquala. Near this place lies also the mysterious Mirage Tower, a place where
few have ventured and even fewer have returned from.

Pain Pleasure~
Legends tell of the origins of these two prominent figures in Anon
mythology.  It is said that their parents were one of the original
settlers who came through magical portals to found a village
known in these times as Kendermore.  Pleasure and Pain are said to be
twin brother and sister, born to common parents.  They were the first born
in the new lands and were the joy of the new village.
   After a year of life in Kendermore, wanderlust began to settle into
their father and other members of the community.  There was a great split
among the kender, for some had lost their wanderlust and wanted to remain
in their village but others wanted to wander the lands.  Until this day
kender always travelled as a group, moving from location to location.
   After much debate the matter was settled.  Any kender that wished to
leave the village was free to do so and any that wished to remain could do
so. For Pain and Pleasure it was a difficult time, for their father wished
to wander while their mother wanted to remain in Kendermore.  The parents
were distraught and torn between their desires and their love for 
their children.
   It was decided that neither parent should be without the company of one
of their children.  Pain was to travel with their father and Pleasure was
to remain with their mother.
   Pain grew up always arms length from the hate, the death and the pain
of the realm.  She felt the pain that her father lived with as he
struggled with his love for her mother and she felt the pain of being
separate from her twin, Pleasure.
   Pleasure was raised as the child of the village.  The village filled
Pleasure with the joy and happiness of life.  But Pleasure always
remembered the joy that he felt as a young child playing with his twin,
Pain.  One day, he felt the need to find his sister and left the village.
   On that same day Pain left her father in search of her brother.  They
wandered aimlessly through the realms searching for their kin.  All this
time they struggled with the violence and the horrors of the lands and
acquired near-godlike skills and strength.
   On the day that they were reunited, legends say that the sun did not
set on the lands.  The light, a symbol, of the God's joy from the twin's
reunification.  They have rarely been seen without the presence of the
other since that day.  It is said that if you should attempt to separate
the brother and sister from each other that you will face the wrath of
mortals unmatched since the days of Godot, the warrior born.
~
E
Godot~
<You can insert the mythical creation of the world here.  This is similar
to gods sevens days or whatever.>

And life began to appear in the realm. Races began to claim territory and
to build their villages.  Chaos reigned as races tested their
might and established their rightful place in the heirarchy of races. Many
smaller races were lost in the ensuing battles.  It was a terrible time.
But in this time there was a hope, a powerful warrior named Godot at
birth, wandered the land preaching peace and co-operation.  He told
his vision of the realm to any who would listen.  Some listened
intently and followed his preachings.  But others saw that in the new
world of peace they would lose much of their power and riches and
despised Godot for his beliefs.  They fought with him but Godot was as
skilled with the blade as he was with his teachings and defeated many
an opponent.  Godot had a great following after a time and the Greater
Gods of the realm began to feel his presence.  They felt that he posed a
threat to their dominion over the realm and confronted him.  But Godot was
supported by two of the Greater Gods who saw the freedom offered by the
new world order.  There was a great battle between the two factions.  The
two Greater Gods who offered their support where driven from the lands
never to be heard from again.
Godot was defeated by the combined might of the Greater Gods.  But he
would not be killed and turned into a martyr.  Instead the Greater Gods
used powerful magic to encase Godot in a magical prison, where he would
stay until the end of his existance.  His followers, hopful that he would
escape the living tomb, still to this day, wait for Godot.

Nemo~
Nemo was born and raised in a small village far to the north and east of
Anonymud, but don't ask for details if you don't want your throat slit.
As a babe, Nemo was entranced by his mother's tales of other lands and other
races.  His favorite stories were of humankind.

His sleep and daydreams were both populated by the Mort d'Arthur, Gawaine and
the Green Knight, and tales by Frank Baum, C. S. Lewis, and Robert Heinlein.
As an adolescent, Nemo was apprenticed as a magician to his uncle, Kamack.
Kamack was a kindly old elf, but Nemo quickly surpassed him in magic ability.
To avoid the dreadfully dull future that awaited him in his native village
and to avoid having to marry his pretty but half-witted cousin Edwina, Nemo
slipped away one summer night to seek out Humankind and his own destiny.
In his adventures, Nemo had many close calls and saw many wonderful sights.
He managed to meet many of the humans he had read about, as well as dwarves,
and kender, and darklings.  He still hasn't figured them all out, but he's
working on it.

Apotheosis~
I first arrived in anonmud and was just a mere 17 year old and had no friends..
then i meet dalamar (dal) and he showed me the tricks of the trade and then i 
was off and running and soon smashing pigs and serfs....i was also a little
bit stupid and a little thief....i used up all my pracs on useless stuff like
stealing and hiding and picking locks...i hope that i can use them for better
use in the future!!! ...and after that i was off and running soon to be a
warrior...i then did some exploring of the huge anon and found many
interesting places but yet to explore all of them cause i doubt it i will find
half of them...i then started to make heaps of friends on this and introduced
some of my friends on this and things got a bit more interesting....things went
nice and smoothly till level 15 or 16 when i realised that i didnt get any free
spells from gath so all my blessings were gone and i had to explore for better
equipment so i could increase everything and especially my damroll...i love
increasing that....oh yeah...im a kender and they are pretty good for non
aggro mobs cause i can backstab them...for aggro mobs...well....different story.
..kenders are very sneaky type of race who have a strong subterfuge rate....
that means stealing i think...i dont find stealing any good cause u get caught
most the time and its better killing them instead cause u might get a extra
body part from them as well....kenders have weak mana so that means that i
cant use much magic during battle and only a average battle rate so my fighting
combat isnt too good....i have a good description too..if u get time to see me
just have a look at me and u will find out. *grin* im kind of a slack mudder
cause i never think before i talk....most the times there is help on the stuff
i want to know but other times i just open my big mouth and ask away...im around
level 27 now and im doing a bit more than tickling the mobs now...im
>>ELEVENS<< them...wohooo....that rocks when it comes out but only on special
occassions....i can pull out thwaps for first hit easy but after that im in a
bit of trouble....heh......that is why i like to group...i have helped and
gotten help from many characters over the past few months and im glad that my
friend showed my this mud...i know you have all heard this one but i hate it
when im just about to level and i die...grrrrr....i have gotten heaps of help
from immortals as well and would like to thank the imms that have helped me
cause i dont think i would be where i am today if it wasnt for you.....what
else?..kenders are suppose to be short little creatures and very attractive i
think...well....im a tall handsome kender warrior who hates dying but likes
fleeing when it works....do u want to hear stories and stuff?? well...i rarely
do explore and when i do i always die cause i dont follow the important rules.
....they are......make sure u know where your going....buy a shimmering potion
or two just in case.......always scan to make sure u dont walk into a trap or
a aggro mob.....and thats about it...heh...too much dribble...better cut it
short...that should be all for now...take it easy...cya apotheosis

Scab...Random House Webster's College Dictionary defines a scab as:
The incrustation that forms over a sore or wound during healing.
There you have it...this Anon veteran lost his arm in the Dwarf-Pixie war
of Mirkwood, and now spends his time picking himself and depositing crust.
Further, he helps anyone who needs any, (just as long as they don't take
offense by the crust) and equips the needy....just ask him for any
assistance you may need, or sip a cup of tea over a friendly game of C4
and enlightening conversation with this Anon veteran.

dalamar~
When I arrived at anonymud I had no clue what I was doing. Top
helped me get to level 2 and from then on I was hooked. I have a lot of
acts of cowardice so I wont even mention any of them..:) But I do have
one act of courage..I killed a green dragon. Now I kill lots of dragons!

Ps:Im looking for the key to dragon tower..If anyone knows where its is
please tell me.

Feenix~
The Coming of Feenix

	Many Many centuries ago, some gods and goddesses got together and 
decided to create a land know as The Realms. This land had all sorts of 
things from avians (bird people) to zombies (undead humanoids). It was a 
great place for a person to start a life of adventure.

	But as time went on, and more people entered The Realms, storms were 
seen on the horizon and blow through The Realms causing disasters and 
deaths. These storms were not natural storms, but rather magical in 
nature. As the storm raged, they dissappeared jsut as quick as they 
came, and it seemed to all like the gods were starting to change.

	As time went on, these 'storms' got worse, and soon it was 
noticed that the 'storms' were caused by the strife between the gods and 
goddesses. With each passing 'storm' the gods and godesses were becoming 
meaner and more bitter to the people that were living in The Realms.

	Feenix Flarestar was born into this world shortly after it was 
created, and chose the path of the Elf, the Master of offensive magic. 
Feenix was an acomplished youg elf, killed many a monster, and died even 
more time than he killed (but that is story for another time). He learned 
the ropes of adventuring in The Realms rather quickly, and made many 
friends, both mortal and  godly.

	As time went on, Feenix brought many other friends into the 
Realms. The sneaky Kender Mara, the strong but stupid dwarf (MadDog), and 
the pretty, but lethal kender, Genivieve. These were valued friends, and 
even more valuable allies, in fighting the evil monster that inhabitated 
The Realms.

	As the months came and went, Feenix started noticing certain 
problems, certain 'storms' so to speak. Feenix, being the quisitive type, 
started to ask questions, but would not get any answers.

	Finally after many many battles, he made it to the ultimate 
mortal phase of life, Hero. Being a hero was all that really mattered to 
him, however, the gods and goddesses have started to change the rules, 
and not telling their heroes as to why or what they were. It was then 
made clear, that even though they said that Policies and Politics had no 
plce in The Realms, they were sadly mistaken. Policies and Politics was 
ALL there was in The Realms.

	As herohood went on for Feenix, he started to notice that things 
were starting to get out of hand, starting to get ridicoulus, and the 
feeling of wanderlust was starting up again.

	Feenix left The Realms and headed out into space, looking for 
more adventure. After many failed attempts at finding it, he located a 
place called Anon. He entered the world as an Elf once again, and started 
his adventuring career. 

	As he slowly progressed, he started to notice that the gods and 
goddesses here were some of the same ones as from The Realms. This maded 
Feenix become a little uneasy. However, he soon found out that THESE Gods 
and Goddesses were far more friendly, and more attentive to the mortals, 
than the other, nameless gods have ever been. 

	That is what brings Feenix here today. Just going with the flow 
of things. Asking questions (even though some are rather stupid), help 
when he can, and wondering...   Will the storms return?

A soft carpet of grass extends to the Main Courtyard of Greystone Villa,

can barely be seen through the semi-opaque yellow windows on the front,
especially with ivy serving as natural decoration for the Halfling Guild.

Greystone Courtyard~
To either side of Greystone Courtyard lie stately edifices.  Where the
nature of humans cause the walls and columns to depict carvings of men and
women doing various routinely tasks, the practicality of dwarves center
around nothing more than a seal above the entrance: A frothy beer mug atop
an anvil.  The trained eye notes, however, that despite the practicality of
the relatively short entrance, the edifice itself matches the height of the
humans', revealing typical dwarven need to not be outdone.  
 
To the west stands the keep of man.
To the east stands the keep of dwarvenkind.

GreenTowers~
Green giants tower up above, blotting out the sky with an enormous
canopy. {YSunlight{x filters through the leafy ceiling, sparkling an
intricate light show.
 
{GMar{Dshla{Gnds{x and the sounds of brutish rivalry are to the {meast{x.
High above the floor to the {csouth{x, querious tribal {Gleafy{x huts
     are barely discernable.
An odd little {wstone{x surrounded by a {mf{Ma{me{Mr{mi{Me {cr{Ci{cn{Cg{x sits to the  
     {ynorth{x, atop a wooded hill.

Knothill~
An odd {wgray stone{x marks the apex of the hill. Upon closer inspection,
it's actually hollow, expressing a scene of nature's magic.
 
Peering {wdown{x into the hollow {wpetrified stump{x reveals a magical forest.
Up in the {Gevergreens{x in the {csouth{x are some mostly-hidden

To the {ysoutheast{x, the odor of {gmar{Dshl{gand{x swamp gas reaches your nose.

You are walking along Glory Avenue.  To the north, Valient Street meets
Glory Avenue to the east and west, while to the south lie two man-made hills,
each to either side of Glory Avenue.  There seems to be some commotion at both

You have reached the southernmost extent of Glory Avenue, the road that
leads to the center of the city.  Tall, mithril gates rise above you to the
south, standing open as they always are, save in times of trouble.  Guardsa
nod politely at you, but remain alert.  Above you, you see murderholes in
the floor of the gatehouse, allowing defenders to pour boiling oil upon any
foolish enough to storm the gates.

anyone who enjoys a stay in an inceberg.  Surrounding the dome, several {cblue{x

the eastern dome structure through holes in the side, as prodded by their

Marble figures line up in rows throughout the hall.  Most are armor-clad,
with swords or spears, while one is atop a horse rearing to the sky, with
her lance levelled straight ahead.  A few wear quivers and bows, and fewer
yet are dressed in only clothing, but cast a determined face and an
outstretched finger.

A throne stands to the north.

The light from the simple (but well cared for) chandelier reveals clean

the olive green walls.  Bookshelves with random nomenclature adorn the walls
intermittently.  At the back of the room, opposite the door, a desk with
stacks of papers, and a snuffed candle stands, under a small round window
whose sill extends a few feet to the back of the hill.  The only thing out
of place is a faded woven throw-rug, lying in the corner.

decidedly square, but a curious dome perched atop it ends with a spire that
pierces the sky.  Four columns at each corner of the building feature a
similiar, but much smaller, dome-spire, too.

A red velvet-like carpet runs from the western wall, and terminates
against the eastern wall.  Halfway along the length, however, another
pathway branches off to the exit to the north.  Curiosities line either side
of the pathway, all encased in glass.  Amorphous blobs, spirals, and pieces
vaguely shaped like humanoid beings make this place their home.  Various
paintings line the walls, some featuring life-size depictions of elves in
various regalia.

This room is unusually round and equally unusually white.  White satin
tapestries pace around the walls, with golden trim, each bearing some type
of totem: a unicorn, a stag, a fox, a doe, a wolf, an elk, and a dragon.  A
round table curves around the room, situated so that those who sit at the
table can talk face to face about pressing matters, or to scrutinize the
comments of the person who stands in the center of the table.

Anon Amphitheater~
A moderately-sized amphitheater draws your attention from the carefully
tended landscape. At the center of the amphitheater is a deis for speakers,
performers, or the weary traveller to peruse. In addition, it would appear
that the stands were designed to accomodate the smallest to the largest of
Thera's races.
 
Along the deis lies an inscription, as well as the location of guilds in
Anon.
 
Greystone Courtyard extends beyond the amphitheater to the north.

The Temple of Anon~
You are standing before the Temple of Anon- a truly majestic structure
constructed from pure marble. Tall Corinthian columns flank an impressive
set of bronze-bound oaken portals, which are never shut save in times of
trouble. Through these doors you can glimpse the majestic interior of the
Temple. Atop the pillars rests a plinth bearing an incredibly well-crafted
frieze which depicts the Immortals of MUD at work creating the World.
To the left of the Temple there is a smaller, but by no means less exquisite, 
structure, which has a single arch on the second floor, accessible by a set 
of ornate marble steps which lead up from near where you are standing. It is
currently closed and locked. Another set of steps leads downward into Anon's 
famed Chamber of Donations. A broad, tree-lined avenue called "Victory Parade" 
runs past the Temple.

Marvelously sculpted likenesses of the Immortals of MUD line the aisle
of this sanctuary of the Gods. Tapestries on the walls depict their victories
over their enemies, and many of the treasures they acquired on such campaigns
are also displayed here. There is a magnificent altar fashioned of purest
obsidian to the north, chased with gold and partially covered with white
cloth. Behind this stands the healer, who will tell you how he can help you
if you look at him.

In these rooms all the unwanted items donated by your fellow adventurers
accumulate. There are shelves, bins, chests and cupboards all filled with 
various articles of equipment. Anyone is free to come here and take what 
they will, but the Immortals frown on greedy characters who take it all,
or profiteers who take it and sell it. Both offenses result in SEVERE
punishment. There is a small sign here.

guards. Stalwart Lane cuts across Victory Parade directly east of here.

dazzling in the sun. Surely they are magical creations of the Elven Mages
of the city.

To the north of here lies the Thaumaturgist's shop, while to the south you

line each side of the street here, and through them you can see the interiors
of fabulously wealthy homes.

A huge crowd seems to have gathered around a large building to the north. 
Perhaps it is for the Trial of Champions, where select adventurers may 
enter the city's dungeons in search of glory and loot?

To the south you can see Thom the Enhancer's place of business.

only a few are for sale- the rest are the owner's personal collection, and
are his pride and joy. To see what to do next, try looking at the owner.

Elves are notorious drinkers, mainly due to the fact that their power relies
solely on mana, and the best way to rapidly regain mana is to be rip-roaring
drunk. Thus it is extremely rare to see an active adventuring Elf remotely
sober.
