The dark cleric of the {DNight{rfall{x clan is here, working her unholy magic.
~
This cleric of darkness is a powerful healer.  She practices her healing
abilities on slaves by bringing them to the brink of death and then
restoring their health, only to do it all over again.  Once a powerful
adventurer who lived to bring pain and suffering to the realms, she was
recruited by Scion and now protects their power with her life, waiting
for the day when the whole land is enslaved, and helpless to resist her
every whim.

This poor girl is suspended upside down by her toes.  Her tears are being

they were once clothes of exquisite elegance.  She may have been royalty or
a priestess of some wealthy god.  Rumour has it that Loviatar was jealous of
the young ladies beauty, but it isn't wise to bring this up with the goddess
of pain.

In a time long, there was a town called Scion.  They were a simple folk, in a simple town.  They were farmers and fishers, tanners and butchers.  Much like many towns of the area they were all human and not welcoming of any other race.  They all so were very fearful of magic.  Even travelling side-show magicians were driven out.   As time grew on they grew more intolerant.
 
One stormy night a dairy-maid gave birth to a slightly deformed child. The child had pointy ears and slanted eyes. Fearing that the child would be a victim of the town, the dairymaid took him to the temple in Scion to be raised.  She hoped that the priests of Ahuramazda would protect him and as he grew in his faith that the gods would protect him too.  It was the priests that named the child Demus.

Demus kept his ears covered in a hood and kept to himself.  The priests were particularly hard on him, they carried the towns prejudices and punished Demus twice as severely as any other child.  He was also made to work harder, pray longer and behave meeker than any other child in the hope that it would keep his soul pure.

The ball in the sky became chaotic.  It continued to grow of its own accord, but now in surges of unstable power.  Thorel prayed for the power to control the magic. The gods seeing the danger united to feed him the power to control it.  Thorel cast all the members of Scion into the 1666 level of the Abyss using their own spell.  Then cast the citadel into a dark chasm.  Then dispersed the spell harmlessly.  For their help in saving the world, Thorel and Thornan were made gods.
 
In the 1666 level of the abyss, it was dark, and filled with the most evil of spirits.  Most members of Scion died within hours of being cast in this abyss.  Though a few managed to survive.  Some learned to communicate with the dark spirits.  The spirits helped them to learn how to adapt to the dark plane.  The dark spirits taught them to ways of seeing into the land of Thera from the Abyss. They then taught them how to fade between the abyss and Thera. Some powerful Scions can still call on the dark spirits to aid them in times of trouble.  With their new skills they planned to rebuild. One day they will be all powerful again. Until then they will wait in the dark and plan.  Killing one by one like their first leader Demus. 

As for what happened to Demus. Well no one knows.  But one day they will find him or he will find them.  The return has been foretold.

page 3~
Demus quickly became powerful and Malarice began fearful of Demus, for as he became more powerful than his master, so did his heart become darker.  Some say that Demus accidently got himself possessed by a demon of the ninth level of hell. But that isn't true. As he grew, the hate for the town of Scion inspired him.

Demus killed his master and used him for a puppet to enter the town of Scion.  Slowly, one by one, Demus turned the town of Scion into undead pawns.  He also summoned Demons and enslaved Angels.  Scion grew quickly. The undead worked tirelessly to create a great citadel. From this citadel they planed to lay siege to heaven.  The counsel of Scion was formed from the most powerful of the evil members of Scion.

Demus decided the best way to attack heaven was to realign the realms.  With all of the dark magic users' power, they sought to cast all in heaven into hell, and all in hell into heaven.   From heaven Scion would have the power to control the world. 

The spell was to take many weeks.  A dark ball of power formed in the sky growing slowly each day. The forces of good revealed its intent and united to combat this spell.  The knights and the rulers stormed the citadel.  All but a few died.  The one knight that made it into the summoning chamber was a young knight named Thorel.  While a young man named Thornan battled in the summoning chamber to distract Demus, Thorel charged Demus and bashed into him, sending him into a rift that had formed.

page 2~
At Demus' coming of age he had to participate in a ceremony with other boys of the village who were coming of age.  The ceremony consisted of challenges that the boys were to compete in front of the guild-masters so that the guild-masters could decide who to chose as apprentices.  The first event was a wrestling match.  Demus wore a scarf to cover his ears.  Demus, who was very meek from the way he was raised, lost quickly.  The victor, a childhood friend of his named Tilli, took off Demus' scarf as a show of victory.
 
The crowd saw Demus' ears, there was panic, fear and then anger.  The crowd stormed the event and chained Demus up in the town centre.  They then flogged him as an example to any outsiders.  The priests prayed over him. They prayed for a quick death for him. At night they left him to bleed to death.
Tilli came at the darkest hour of the night.  Filled with guilt at what he had done, he freed Demus.  He put Demus on a horse and helped him escape.  When some villagers caught up Tilli slapped the horse on the rump and Demus escaped them.  Tilli was slain.
 
Demus travelled through the realm. Going from village to village.  Stealing to survive.  Until one day he stole from a cruel magician, Malarice.  At first the Malarice enslaved him, but seeing a great talent in Demus, decided to teach him the dark arts of Necromancy.

Before an Evil Chasm~
In the distance you see a dark chasm that seems to be where, even here,
you can sense much evil has radiates from it.  There is a strange dark
creature that stands in front of the chasm but you can only make out the a
shadow.  The chasm seems to go down for miles and miles with no end in site.
There is a strange sound that you can only just hear.  It seems to come from
with in the chasm.  It sounds like a steady chanting.  Sometimes there is
even a scream.  Is it just demons talking or maybe something even worse.  A
strange scent that you can't quit place.  You may need to go closer to find
out what it is.  You would have to be of an evil persuasion to feel at home
in a place like this.

Entrance to the Dark Chasm~
There is a large dark monster here guarding the entrance of the chasm. 
Evil power radiates from this being.  It stands there in anticipation of a
fight.  There is a line in the dirt that he is just waiting for you to
cross.  Down past the guardian are sounds of chanting and the occasional
tortured scream.  The smell of blood waft out of the entrance.  This place
is a place of dread, which lowers the spirits of all but the most corrupt
and devious beings.

Top of Stairs into the Chasm~
Here is the top of the staircase.  There are no hand railings to begin
with and it seems to just be chiselled out of the stone, but as it goes down
it become more defined and more detailed.  To the north is the entrance
where the {DN{Ri{Dg{Rh{Dt {RW{Da{Rl{Dk{Re{Dr{x is.  The chanting you hear is
louder, and the smell of blood is stronger.

Midway of Stairs into the Chasm~
Here is the middle of the staircase, and this is where you can see the
greatest contrast.  Above you is a crumbling entrance to the chasm, where
you are now is the beginning of handrails.  The stairs become more evenly
cut.  Candles now line the walls.  The walls are changing from uncut rock to
Black marble and not much farther down the stairs are covered in red carpet.
You can still hear the chanting but it now sounds more harmonious and the
smell the blood seems sweeter.

Lower Stairs into the Chasm~
The shadows of the beast seem to be moving quickly along with you and
they look at you hungerly and yet they are not attacking you wonder why when
they surly could take you.  There is the sound of hammering coming in
clearly now.  It seems that a great black smith must be working for these
legions of evil beast.

Bottom of the Stairs into the Chasm~
This is the true entrance to Scion.  The handrails are silver, the red
carpet is lush and thick.  This is a place of power.  Red candles light the
room.  Black gargoyles hang from the black marble walls.  Their eyes follow
your movements.  A large {ygolden archway{x with satanic symbols marks the
entrance to the inner sanctum.  The chanting is now more than music, it is
now a powerful energy that washes over you.  The smell of blood is now
intoxicating and makes you a little giddy.

Heart of the Chasm~
This room seems to be the heart of the chasm and it looks like you can go
east west south north or down.  Down you can go into the smith and east you

like training rooms.

Southern cavern of the Chasm~
You have reached the south end of the cave.  It looks like only 3 ways to
go back north or up to the donation pit or down to the heros meeting room. 
There is cold dark shadow here muttering something over and over.  It seems
that you feel dizzy and you mind is playing tricks on you.  You wake up and
you notice that you have fallen down and had a nice nap but you have no idea
why.

The Vault Room~
A large adamantite vault is here.  This is where the Scion clan members
store their dark treasures.  The riches aren't always of the gold and silver
type.  Dark magics are what the Scion clan covets most.  Items of power and
cruelty lie in the depths of this vault.

You are in a dark room.  The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the
wet dungeon walls.  This is where slaves and prisoners of Scion are kept. 
This is also where Scions' vampires come to feed.  There is very little down
here.  There you can hear pleading from some of the slaves.

In the centre of the room is a large mahogany boardroom table.  There is a
small summoning circle in the centre of the table that they use for
communicating to dark powers.  Around the table are many small chairs with
the chairs of the leaders at elevated ends of the table.  Many plans and

Chasm Smith~
This room seems to be where the sounds of weapon making came from.  There
is a black smith standing here looking at you making you quake in fear. 
Theres such a smell from him that it makes you fall to the ground in tears. 
He has a strange feel come off him that makes you feel uneasy but still able
to speak.  He goes back to work slowly and starts to make a brand to make a
sword for all his evil friends to use.  It looks like this sword could go
through a rock and still be as sharp as ever.  There is the sounds of a evil
priest someone near and it sounds like there people working on magic and
working on the physical skills as well.

A Leap of Faith~
You are standing at the bottom of a long staircase that disappears into
the blackness above.  Your light reflects off the smooth rock wall to the
west, its rays glimmering upward feebly to reveal the dome-like structure of
the cavern that you are in.  A doorway opens into the wall toward the west,
but beyond the opening, there is nothing to see.  Your light simply can not
penetrate the darkness.
