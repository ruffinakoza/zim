down her back, this woman is perhaps the most beautiful creature you have

flawless skin.  Her lips and cheeks are red, giving her a flush of life that
looks odd considering the fact that she doesn't seem fully of this world. 
She seems to switch between being solid and translucent, but looks totally
unaware of what is happening.  Her cheeks are stained with tears, and she
weeps miserably, though even red, sore eyes do little to mar her beauty.

healing powers.

{gAdventurers just starting out shouldn’t just run around blindly, entering 
any abandoned tower that catches their eye! Some places can be quite 
dangerous, and its important to know where to start and gain some 
experience before moving on to doing the big stuff. So here’s a couple 
places those just starting out on their voyages may want to visit, to earn a 
little money and experience.{x
 
{WZoo of Midgaard{x
Midgaard has a lovely zoo, a truly wonderful place to visit. Though it 
might seem like a place for children, there’s a little something there for 
everyone, and it’s not a bad place to spend the day.
You’ll find it in the southern half of Midgaard, with an entrance in the 
park.
{WElemental Canyon{x
Elemental Canyon is quite a place to see! Lots of different creatures, all 
serving their own particular rulers, and all living at peace with each other. 
A lesson there for everyone to learn, but you should really see it for 
yourself.
You’ll find it up in the mountains in the lowest and southernmost part of 
the dwarf forest.
{WShire{x
The shire is a lovely place, filled with good people of decent height. 
There may not be a lot of action there but it’s a great place to relax and 
take it easy, whether your idea of a good time is relaxing with a nice 
glass of ale or playing in a green field.
You’ll find it at the first turn north, heading out of the western gates of 
Midgaard. Make sure to follow the path to the north, and don’t take any 
side roads, as there is a rather dark castle nearby inhabited by people who 
are somewhat less friendly than the shire folk.
{WDwarven Kingdom{x
Another group of decently sized people, though somewhat surly, if you 
ask me. The Dwarven Kingdom is still a nice place to visit. The younger 
ones among you might enjoy visiting the daycare, while the area to the 
north is a better place for those just seeking adventure.
You can reach it by traveling north of the crossroads that are to the west 
of the city of New Thalos, and taking the second turn to the east. 
{WMarsh{x
Those of you looking for a little excitement might want to visit the Marsh. 
It’s filled with all sorts of scary (to some) creatures, like trolls and snakes 
and wolves. It’s a rather dangerous place, so don’t go there unprepared. 
But it should be just wild enough to satisfy those with a taste for adventure.
The Marsh is somewhere in the south-west of the forest west of Midgaard, 
also known as the Forest of Nowhere.

{gA lot of adventurers reach the point where they’ve traveled across the 
realms, seen a lot of beautiful places, but they just feel as if they want more. 
A little excitement, maybe. The following places are suggested for those 
who have seen some of the world, and are looking for a little bit more of a 
challenge.{x
 
{WDylan’s Area{x
Dylan’s Area is definitely a challenge. There are harpies all around, and they 
don’t seem to be too fond of visitors. Still, for those willing to look past the 
danger (and the stench), Dylan’s Area has a lot to offer. There’s beauty, 
there’s excitement, and maybe even a treasure or two. 
It can be reached by heading to the southern half of Midgaard, and climbing 
up a chain that leads right into the sky. Dylan’s area will be a little to the 
south and then up in the clouds from the top of the chain. If you see bunnies 
of any kind, you’ve gone too far!
{WUnderdark{x
The Underdark has really gotten a bad reputation. True, it’s the home of 
thieves, murderers and worse, but most will leave you alone if you mind 
your own business. It truly is a wonderful place to visit for those who are 
curious about what life is like so far underground, and those who are 
curious to see how its denizens life day to day.
It can be accessed by heading straight north through the mines of Moria, 
which themselves are straight north from the Crossroads west of New 
Thalos. The entrance is through a hidden door in the ground.
{WColiseum of Midgaard{x
The coliseum in Midgaard is an interesting place, filled with warriors 
and exotic beasts. A great place to go and test your strength, if that’s what 
you enjoy. You’ll find plenty of men and women who share your passion 
there, though the folks in the stands aren’t quite so friendly.
The coliseum can be found in the western half of Midgaard, a bit south 
from the Western Gates.
{WHigh Tower of Sorcery{x
The High Tower of Sorcery is another neat place. Most of the people who 
visit it are magic users, but there’s something there for everyone. If you’re 
hunting for magic scrolls and objects, it’s a great place to start!
Getting to it is a bit more complicated, though. There is a shadow grove 
that can be accessed by going to the western edge of the forest to the west 
of Midgaard. The grove can be a bit confusing, but if you ask the lost 
adventurer for help, I’m sure he could direct you to the tower.

night face ring~
Power of a direct lunar connection radiates off the Night Face and it
almost seems to vibrate when in contact with moon light.  The golden band is
small and meant for use by slender fingers.  The brim of the band is traced
in silvery runes of a broken language once used by those who paid homage to
the Moon.  Centered on the band of the ring is a small white sphere that can
only be made of Moon Stone.  The sphere echoes the path of the Moon, ranging
from a lifeless rock to a bright glowing ball.  Despite the presence of
power given off by Night Face it remains cold and dead to the touch.

These skirts did not hamper the movement of ones legs, making them free to
strike faster and swifter not having to worry about their footwork.  This
finely woven battleskirt has become popluar again by those who wish the
liberty of free movement over the protection of heavy Iron.

The Center Square~
The center square lies at the heart of the city, and is one of its busiest 
intersections. Crowds of people push passed each other, heading in all
directions. Shops line the streets everywhere you look, and several traders 
have set up stands along the square, selling trinkets and cheap food. The 
air here is thick with the scent of exotic perfume, worn by women passing 
through the crowd, as well as the smells of spicy food sold by nearby 
vendors.

The trade road is a wide boulevard running between the eastern and 
western gates of the city. A narrow strip of land runs through the center 
of the road, trees and flowers growing along its length. The crowds here 
are thick, people heading in every direction, most of them entering one 
of the many shops located along the road. Loud cries from the vendors 
along the road, along with the multitude of voices coming from the 
crowd and the sounds of passing trade wagons all join together to make

Trade Street~
The trade road is a wide boulevard running between the eastern and 
western gates of the city. A narrow strip of land runs through the center 
of the road, trees and flowers growing along its length. The crowds here 
are thick, people heading in every direction, most of them entering one 
of the many shops located along the road. Loud cries from the vendors 
along the road, along with the multitude of voices coming from the 
crowd and the sounds of passing trade wagons all join together to make 
it difficult to hear anything above the din. A path leads south up to a
tall white tower that glitters in the light.

The western gate sees a little less traffic than the other gates leading 
into the city, because a thick forest lies beyond it, but nevertheless it 
is still well-guarded. The gate is fairly large, with enough room for 
several wagons to pass through side by side. It is set into the white 
stone wall that runs around the city, and looks to be fairly sturdy. Two 
small towers are built into the wall right next to the gates, where guards 
can keep an eye on anyone approaching the city.

Jerrar's Imported Goods~
A wide assortment of goods can be found in this shop, ranging from
beautiful and expensive-looking rugs to fine glass plates and cups.
Many of the items for sale look to have been imported from far-off
lands, to be sold here at an exorbitant price. A man stands behind a
wooden counter, sorting through newly acquired goods.

The Butcher Shop~
The smell of roasting meat doesn’t quite cover the scent of blood
and raw flesh in this shop, but it does keep it at a bearable level.
Large slabs of meat hang from hooks all around the walls of the
shop, and smaller cuts of meat are placed behind the counter, ready
to be sold. The butcher keeps a clean shop, and is well-known for
his insistence on selling only the best meat.

The bank is a fairly large building, with a large staff to accommodate
the many people who come here to take care of their financial business 
every day. The walls and floor are made of polished white marble,
giving the building a bright and airy feel. Behind the counter, which
is staffed by several tellers, the entrance to a large vault can be seen,
kept locked and under heavy guard.

The wonderful aroma of freshly-made bread fills this small bakery, 
along with the sweeter scent of pastries and cookies. Fresh bread, 
some of it still warm, is displayed all around the shop, in every shape 
and size. Some of it has been baked with spices or fruits or whatever 
else the baker could think of, and all of it looks delicious. Behind
the counter lies the kitchen, where the baker’s assistant can be seen

The Mercenary Guild~
The mercenary’s guild is bustling with activity, its wide front hall 
filled with a crowd of people seeking the services the guild has to offer. 
The mercenaries put money above all, however, and lend their services 
to those who can pay the highest price, not those who arrived first. The 
hall itself is a simple room of dark stone, fairly wide and with a high 
ceiling. At the far end a gnome holds a ledger and speaks with those 
seeking to hire the guild for work, writing down the amount they are 
willing to pay.

Tall shelves line the walls of this tiny shop, filled with trinkets,

presumably contains items of great power. This is the shop of a great

A small path of white stone branches off from the road to the north. 
Trees and flowers have been planted along the path, so thick that there’s 
an illusion of a forest right in the middle of the city. The sounds of the
city are muted here, making it feel as if it truly is a forest. To the south 
a tall white tower rises up, its pale stone walls glittering in the light.

A light flow of traffic runs through the southern gate, mostly travelers 
and farmers coming and going from their nearby land. Two wide, tall gates 
are set into the white stone walls surrounding the city, wide enough to let 
several wagons pass through at once, though this gate rarely sees anything 
other than farmers' wagons. On either side of the gate stand two towers 
where guards can keep a lookout and see everyone coming towards the city.

around the room, doing little to dispel the shadows. Shady-looking men 
sit amongst the sailors and dockworkers, all of them looking to be a 
rough bunch. A long bar at the end of the room serves cheap beer and 
ale, as well as a few scraps of food. No one seems to be paying much

The thief’s guild is located in an old, run-down warehouse. This was
once the main room of the warehouse, but it is now completely bare
of any furnishings or decorations, except for a few chairs against the
walls which have been bolted to the floor. Very little sign is given
that anyone makes use of this building, because the thieves must be
ready to take off at any time if the city’s guards become suspicious.

waiting for their ships to set sail again. Narrow stairs lead up to a hallway 
with some rooms for rent, though a sign by the railing declares that there 
are no vacancies. A few windows let in some fresh air, as well as a little 
light, but the inn is still uncomfortably hot. Several games of dice seem to 
be going on around the room, and lots of money seems to be changing 
hands, as every now and then raucous laughter erupts from one of the 
tables. One of the groups of sailors seems to have room for one more at 
their table, if you’re willing to gamble.

makes it difficult to maintain a good footing. Big burly men walk along 
the docks, barefoot, carrying heavy crates on their backs to be loaded 
onto one of the large merchant ships docked by the wharf, or to be 
dropped off at a warehouse and sold in the city. The cries of sailors as 
they work on their ships fills the docks, along with the sharp cries of the 
seagulls flying overhead. The smell of fish is thick in the air, and the 
breeze carries the scent of salt from the river. At the end of the docks,
several large merchant ships are being loaded and unloaded, bringing
goods to and from the city for trade. By the looks of them, their captains
make a fair amount of profit from their efforts.

The Docks~
The smooth wooden planks of the docks are wet and slippery, which 
makes it difficult to maintain a good footing. Big burly men walk along 
the docks, barefoot, carrying heavy crates on their backs to be loaded 
onto one of the large merchant ships docked by the wharf, or to be 
dropped off at a warehouse and sold in the city. The cries of sailors as 
they work on their ships fills the docks, along with the sharp cries of the 
seagulls flying overhead. The smell of fish is thick in the air, and the 
breeze carries the scent of salt from the river. At the end of the docks,
several large merchant ships are being loaded and unloaded, bringing
goods to and from the city for trade. By the looks of them, their captains
make a fair amount of profit from their efforts.

Boat Shop~
Several boats of various quality are lined up in a row by the river, all 
of them for sale. A man is bent over one of the boats that looks to be half 
complete, running a keen eye over it and pulling out a long-handled knife 
to make some adjustments. Most of the boats here look to be simple and 
practical, nothing like the large merchants ships that move along the river.

Fish Market~
The stench of fish is almost overpowering here, combining with the hot

set up here, filled with some of the different types of fish that are found 
in the river. Several fisherman walk along the market, bringing baskets 
filled with fish to sell to the traders or setting up shop themselves to sell 
their catches. Most of the shops are covered with canopies to provide at 
least a little protection from the weather outside.

The river here is narrow, but still wide enough to allow merchant ships
and fishermen’s boats to move about with a good deal of space between them. 
The scent of salt is strong in the air, and the water below moves in big,
irregular waves, disturbed by all the great ships moving to and from the
nearby docks.  This part of the river is quite busy, the docks lying just to
the south, and over a dozen large merchant docked and handling their trading
business.

The river lies in shade beneath the bridge, and the air is refreshingly

lace but standing strong even ages after it was built.  The white stone
glitters whenever the light hits it, sending off sparkling reflections
across the water.

lime, or stretched out on racks to be cut and shaped. A long wooden

The Practice Yard~
Large, dangerous-looking men and women fight against each other 
in this yard, most of them using wooden practice weapons. A practice 
dummy stands at the western end of the yard, barely still attached to 
its post. Every now and then someone cries out in pain as their 
opponent strikes a weak point, but they soon recover and resume the 
fight. A small stone building lies to the east, its open door revealing 
the source of all the practice weapons and shields.

The Weapon Racks~
Most of this small room is reserved for stacks holding up wooden
weapons and practice shields. Dirt from the training yard outside has
been tracked all over the floor, but no one seems to notice. A few 
warriors stand before the racks, testing the balance of the weapons
before they go out to train with them. The guildmaster stands at the
end of the room, holding up a wooden sword and practicing his forms
in front of a student.

Training Yard~
Thick stone walls about fifteen feet high surround the training yard, 
making sure that the fights within don’t break out into the rest of the 
city. Against one part of the wall a large blood stain has dried, making 
it look as if someone was gravely injured there recently. Packed dirt 
lies on the ground along the yard, dust rising up with almost every 
step you take. A few training dummies stand off the side of the yard, 
though they are rarely used, as most of the people who come here use 
the space as an arena to test their skills against fellow fighters.

This small shop is famous for its maps, and travelers come from all over 
to speak with the owner about his past adventures and try to pry a few 
secret locations from him. The maps are kept on shelves behind the counter, 
carefully labeled and separated into different groups depending on their 
value. Behind the counter stands Calgi, ready to convince anyone who walks 
into his shop that they can’t truly see all that the world has to offer without

out from small cages, singing from their perches. Tiny little hamsters 
run around on wheels, or pile up to sleep in the corner of their cages, 
one on top of the other. The larger animals are kept in small rooms, 
where visitors can look in on them through a glass window. The animals 
seem to be well-taken care of, and healthy.

little to dispel the shadows. From the looks of it, this place was once
a humble home, but it has long been abandoned. At first glance it 
doesn’t seem as if this building has seen much use recently, but tracks 
on the floor lead through the dust to a trapdoor set into the ground, 
making it clear that many feet have recently passed this way.

There is little traffic going through the northern gate, and what there is 
consists mostly of adventurers seeking to explore the vast plains beyond 
and villagers returning home after trading their surplus goods at the market.
The gates are wide and well guarded despite the few people that pass through
them daily. The walls surrounding the gate are made of pure white stone that 
glitters as the light hits it, and two small towers are set into the wall next to
the gates, allowing the guards to keep an eye on the surrounding area.

The Temple of Twilight~
The entrance to the temple is truly a marvelous sight to behold. Pale
steps of white stone lead up to the marble doors, which are decorated
with verses and prayers praising the Goddess of Twilight. The walls
of the temple are of a rose-orange stone, the same shade as the sky at
dusk. Large windows set into the walls are opened as night falls to allow
the fading light to make its way across the temple floor. After scion,
thousands of candles are lit, and their light blends in with the stone of
the walls to create the illusion of permanent twilight. An altar, made up 
from the same rose-orange stone as the walls lies at the very center of the 
room, placed to catch the last of the sun’s rays as darkness falls.

The altar is simply made, from the same stone as the walls. It is used in
rituals at twilight time, when the sun's rays reach through the windows to
illuminate it.
~
E
candles~
The candles are only lit and night, and extinguished at dawn. When lit,
their light blends with that of the walls to create a stunningly beautiful
representation of twilight.

The windows are cut into the stone, closed during the day and at night 
but opened as the sun begins to set for the rituals performed here at
twilight.

verses prayers doors marble~
Several famous verses and prayers have been carved on the doors, 
praising the goddess. One in particular that is carved on the handle
stands out above the rest. It appears to be a dedication of this temple
to the goddess.

The Donation Room~
This room is rather modest and bare of furnishings. It is where the poorer 
citizens of Caerlon come to receive blessings and a helping hand from the 
temple. A large table at the center of the room holds food and water for the 
hungry, and a large chest by the wall holds items donated by the more
fortunate followers of the goddess.

The Chamber of Contemplation~
The furnishings in this chamber are quite simple, comprised of a large
chest of dark wood placed against the western wall, and a small altar 
where supplicants can come to pray to the goddess. There is a stillness
and quietness to this room that even the worshippers can do little to break.
Tall open doors lead back to the entrance of the temple.

This chamber is small and windowless, but the walls and domed ceiling 
give the impression that it is much larger. The dome has been painted
with a scene of approaching scion, clouds glowing pink and orange
as the sun slowly sets in the distance. Several soft mats have been spread
out on the floor for weary adventurers and worshippers on pilgrimages to
sleep on, and a feeling of peace permeates the room.

Temple Street~
This street is really nothing more than a small side street paved with 
cobblestones. No palaces or grand buildings are found here, just trees
and flowers and a sense of peace. Few people walk the street here, and
those who do seem lost in contemplation, moving slowly past you 
before disappearing through a bend in the road to the east or fading
back into the crowd of Center Street.

Temple Street~
The cobblestone street here is shaded by tall trees growing along its 
side, their branches and leaves making patterns on the ground as the light
shines down through them and the breeze shakes them gently. The street 
is quiet here, with the sounds of the city muted and seeming to come from 
far off. The road takes a bend here, heading north through the trees where 
a small shrine is just barely visible and west back into the main part of 
the city.

The Dirt Path Through the Clearing~
The street here narrows into a dirt path, packed hard by the many feet 
that travel it every day. This space forms a clearing in the small woods 
in the center of the city. A small shrine is visible through the trees to the
east, but this open area beneath the sky feels just as sacred as any shrine, 
though no man-made object or building is here to mark it as such.

A small shrine is here, surrounded by the trees. The dirt path leads up
to it, ending just a few feet away. Soft grass surrounds the shrine, which
is a small structure made of pale gray stone. The shrine itself is dedicated 
to those gods of the realm who serve the cause of neutrality and balance. 
A small pool of clear water is by the shrine, used in performing rituals of
purification.

Jewelry Store~
This shop is rather small, but it is obvious to any the moment that 
they enter that the proprietor is quite wealthy. Finely woven tapestries 
hang on each wall, fit for a palace. This is one of the most famous 
shops in Caerlon, and people come from almost every corner of the realms 
to try and get their hands on some of the jewelry that is sold here. A tall, 
well-dressed woman stands behind a glass counter displaying some of her 
finest creations.
 
      A small sign has been placed on the counter.

about my 'customized jewelry', and we may be able to work something
out. My apologies for any inconveniences this may have caused.

A Wide, Paved Street between the Palaces~
A wide tree-lined road weaves its way through the palaces in this part 
of the city. Rather than following a straight line, it weaves around hills 
and trees and any other obstacle in its path, following a natural course 
rather than cutting through the land. The homes along this street are quite 
stunning, and this part of the city seems to hold the most creative 
architecture. No house is the same, and few follow the pattern of golden 
domed palaces found in the rest of Caerlon, but all are quite lovely.

The Entrance to the Laughing Pig~
Immediately upon stepping into the inn, its warm, cozy atmosphere 
becomes apparent. The windows have been left open to let in some fresh 
air, and to try to dispel the day’s heat. On the far side of the wall is a 
long stone fireplace, filled with logs ready for burning should it get too 
cold. Tables are set throughout the room, many of them filled with cheerful 
patrons relaxing after a hard day’s work. A clear, strong voice can be 
heard singing from the far end of the room, accompanied by a harp.

The Kitchen~
Cooks and serving girls move about the kitchen, preparing food for the
inn’s hungry customers.  Mouth-watering aromas come from the meat being
turned on the spits, and vegetables are cooking in pots over the fire, all
of which look very appealing.  There is a thick scent of spices in the air,
and one look at any of the plates heading out into the inn shows why.  A
small door to the north leads to a storage room where many of the foods and
spices are kept, while to the south the kitchen continues.

The Storeroom~
Small shelves and boxes line the room, filled with spices and dried
food..  Some of the spices are rather exotic and seem to have been imported
from afar, like the tiny white peppers kept in a small crate onto which
words imprinted in an unfamiliar script.  A large rack on the far end of the
room holds the spiced wine for which the inn is famous.  The freshest foods
are kept closer to the door, in easy reach.  The only light in this room is
from a small oil lamp kept by the door and lit when needed, so as to prevent
any fires.

The Kitchen~
A large table at this end of the kitchen is filled with small trays
holding food and drinks ready to be taken out into the common room.  Judging
by the wide variety of delicious-looking food that can be seen here, the
cook is quite accomplished at her craft.  A small rack by the wall holds the
less expensive wine that the inn has to offer.  Above it is a large open
window, helping to dispel the heat of the ovens.

A small hallway goes from the common room up to some wooden steps that
lead to the private rooms of the inn’s guests.  There is little to see in
this room, other than a small table holding a vase full of flowers.  The
sounds of the inn are muted here, and the air is slightly cooler than the
rest of the building.  A small breeze flutters the curtains on a window by

placed near the door, with a small mirror hanging above it.  A wardrobe lies

the far side of the wall, under a window left slightly open to allow a nice,
fresh breeze to drift in.  The window looks out over the land behind the
inn, soft green grass and a large tree beneath which a table is set for
those wishing to have a meal outdoors.  There is a fresh scent to the room,
as if it has just been clean.  A few articles of clothing set out on the
bed, and an open chest filled with personal belongings shows this room is

for quite some time.  The window is shut tight, and the room has a rather
hot and stuffy feel to it, but it is a bit larger than the rest of the rooms
at the inn.  The wardrobe is filled with fine coats, some of them made of
silk with lace at the cuffs and collar, embroidered with golden threads
along the sleeves.  Various small instruments are placed around the room,
and a large book of songs and poems is spread open on the bed.  A large harp

Upon entering the room a musty smell is immediately evident.  The entire
room is packed with books, covering every flat surface and placed in piles
up against the wall.  Not a single chair is left without a stack of books on
it, and even the tiny bed is covered with scrolls and ancient looking texts.
There is barely any room to walk between all the piles, and the smell of the
old books is almost overpowering.

A quiet tree-lined road moves between the palaces, meeting back with
Center Street to the west and continuing on towards a large building to the
east.  Few people walk along this street, and those who do seem mostly to be
officials on their way to conduct some business.  Above the road a gentle
breeze shakes the branches of the trees, combining with the songs of birds
to give it a peaceful feel.

The Wavedancer is a large ship, its captain a very successful merchant. 
Cabins have been provided below for those who wish to rest, though the trip
to Midgard is short enough to make them unnecessary.  The ship lives up to

salt.

say Customized jewelry? Why yes, I've made some in the past. In fact it used to make up a large part of my business. The secret to drawing out the magical powers of ordinary jewels has been kept by my family for generations, and no others in all the lands can do it like we can. However there are certain components that are needed in order to do this.
say The jewels should be simple enough to get, Jandar keeps a good supply in his shop in the city. I'll need special oils on top of that, to bless the pieces.
mob echo Frowning sadly, the jeweler continues.
mob echo '{GThere used to be a trader, a man who would travel across the lands and bring me back what I needed whenever he stopped by the city.

say Excellent, it will be a pleasure to work on such a piece again! Now, I've never been to these places myself, so all I have to go by are the old trader's descriptions, may the gods find him peace.
mob echo Pulling out a small book, the jeweler begins to read through its contents.
say This craft of mine has been passed down through my family for generations. In ancient days there used to be temples all over the land, and in these temples priests and priestesses of the gods would create blessed oils, used for various purposes throughout the lands. The gods worshipped there fell out of favour, and the temples were lost, along with the supplies of these blessed oils.
mob echo Running a hand through her hair, the jeweler continues.
mob echo '{GThe only way to get these oils now is by finding them in the temples themselves. Few people know where they are, but I know enough to perhaps guide you there if you know the lands well enough. The problem is, specific oils are needed to bring out the qualities in the jewelery I make. What works for one won't work for another. It will be far simpler for you to tell me which kind of bracelet you're interested in.{x'
mob echo Placing the book on the counter, the jeweler begins to read a list of jewels.
mob echo '{GI can make you bracelets made of either a sapphire, moonstone, black pearl, fire opal, ruby, emerald, diamond or a piece of snowflake obsidian. Tell me which you are interested in, and I'll let you know where you can find the oils that will allow me to draw out their power.{x'

#HELPS
92 0 Nalaeya 'hero equipment'~
Once heroes have bought a house, they are entitled to customized
equipment that will allow them greater control over how they can
present themselves to the world.
 
This equipment will simply be regular equipment that they bring to
have renamed with the description changed to what they have chosen.
 
Heroes will be allowed one piece that they can customize themselves,
using no more than 300 build points and following bp rules. This
piece will be rotdeath and limited to 1, and will repop in their
houses.
 
Should a hero die and have their equipment taken from them, they can
get a new set free of cost as long as they bring the items they wish
to have renamed.
~
92 0 Shaelindra 'hero equipment'~
This is a continuation of Nalaeya's help file.
 
1) Weapons being renamed may also have their damtype altered so that they may
"make sense." The exception is that the damtype cannot be changed to cleave, but
if it is cleave to begin with, they may use cleave at their discretion. Also,
they may opt to change the type of weapon to exotic, at their discretion.
 
2) Benign flags may be added or removed also in order to make sense, however
they will have to pay twice as much for elemental flag changes.
 
3) Benign flags may be added or removed to armor. I.E. a gleaming, mirrored
cuirass of shaelindra might not have the dark flag.
 
4) Obj progging is NOT allowed (unless someone wants to go to the effort to
make it to where builders can objprog within OLC. Any takers? No, I didn't
think so).
