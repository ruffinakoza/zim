A small creek has formed from a rockface, or at least it appears to be a
creek. In actuality it looks to be a mass exodus of thousands upon thousands
of fattened {&maggots{x looking to devour anything in their path.{x

The flowing maggots taper off into a waterfall of sorts.  They fall
endlessly onto the poor soul that was imprisoned here.  It appears to
possibly be a male drow elf.  He is bound to the rock face with chains of
living shadow.  He screams in silence, for his throat has long been
devoured.  For some reason, he appears to be regenerating even as the
maggots feast upon his dark flesh.  A terrible punishment indeed.
