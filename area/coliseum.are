The West Entrance~
You are standing near the western, and main entrance to the arena.
A battle royal is taking place now.  You see fallen gladiators everywhere
you look; slashing, gouging, beheading and disemboweling each other purely
for the entertainment of the bloodthirsty spectators.  

 The main entrance and vestibule lie directly to the west.

The East Wall~
You are standing at the eastern side of the arena.  The walls that
surround it are made from solid blocks of marble, each weighing several
tons.  The Coliseum must have been constructed years ago.  The marble is
cracked, graying, and beginning to crumble with age.

Inside the Arena~
You are standing in the battle arena.  The clanging of trident and sword
on shield, punctuated by grunts and cries sound from all around.  Dark
stains of dried and drying blood cover the pale yellow sand underfoot.  The
snapped off shaft of a javelin protrudes from the ground nearby.

You are walking through the spectator stands and the roars of the excited
crowds are deafening.  Dozens of gladiators have fallen today, accompanied
by the derisive hoots and catcalls of the spectators.  You feel your own
blood beginning to boil.  Look at these cowards, leering at the fallen
warriors, greedily drinking in the bloody spectacle.  You feel nothing but
repulsion for the mindless fools that you see around you, and your hatred
begins to mount.

The Harem~
Dozens of scantily-clad, beautiful women are reclining on silken pillows
around the room.  Sticks of sweet smelling incense burn in copper holders at
a dozen different locations in the room.  Your head begins to swim, and
you're not sure if it's the intoxicating smell, or the marvelous sights that
are making you so dizzy...

The Steam Room~
Hot steam pours into the room through tiny ducts near the ceiling. 
Wooden reclining benches have been placed against the walls, all of the way
around the room.  You hear the sound of giggling, and as you turn your head
about, you notice several human forms near you.

{bA Subterranean Cavern{x~
You plunge into the pool of water and are surprised to find yourself
inside an old well which leads far beneath the sanctum.  Curiosity impels
you to dive further downwards, and after swimming for what seems like an
eternity, you find yourself in a vast subterranean cavern.  Your lungs are
beginning to burn from the lack of oxygen, and you still have to swim back
to the surface.  Hmm, perhaps you'd better turn back now.

stones wall bricks mortar~
Staring hard into the murky water you see the outline of a hole in the
west wall of the cavern.  Looks like it was cemented in with stones
 centuries ago.
~
D3
A large hole in the west wall has been sealed with bricks and mortar, and
upon closer inspection you notice a strange symbol on the middle of it. 

 It is a warning of some kind; a glowing eye, streaming teardrops of blood.

{bA Burial Vault{x~
You are swimming in a murky, water-filled burial vault.  Looking around,
you guess that it has lain undisturbed for centuries.  A long black casket
lies mostly buried in the mud, and your curiosity is piqued, but something
is wrong about this place.  Something is VERY wrong, and your mind screams
for you to leave.
