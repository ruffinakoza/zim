the witch guildmaster~
A tall woman stands here, peering thoughtfully into the pool.
~
Tall, with long graying hair, this human is well past her middle years, but 
one look into her deep grey eyes convinces you that she is by no means 
past her prime. She wears a white dress that falls to her ankles and covers 
most of her body, which seems to be surrounded by a mystical aura. She 
nods and smiles as she meets your eyes, prepared to teach you if she thinks 
you’re ready.

The grocer is a man in his middle years, tall and thin. His short brown

Taelan~
Taelan, the tavern's owner stands here, taking orders and joking with the patrons.
~
Taelan is a balding man, with only a few hairs left on his head, and most of them
graying. He's large enough for two men, though most of that is due to his inability
to resist his own cook's food. It's well known around Fayten that Taelan is
over-protective of his only daughter, Danalia, and he watches every young man
coming to his tavern like a hawk. Despite this, he's well-liked by those who
frequent his tavern, and is a respected figure across Fayten.

map local villages towns~
There are many small towns and villages to visit across the realms.
Here are a few that might be of interest.

The {yCity of Anon{x can be reached through the ruins of Thalos, which are 
located south and west of the crossroads just east of Midgaard. Once 
inside Thalos, simply head south and follow the southern wall until a 
ruined watchtower comes into view. At that point, step north, then west 
into a building, and south, and you shall find yourself in the city of Anon. 
From the entrance, heading straight west will lead to the Village of Anon. 
To those who seek to find the Walls of Anon, they are also west of the 
entrance, through closed doors that are located on the north and south 
side of the road.
 
{yFreeport{x might interest those who like to be surrounded by money. It’s 
a small trading town to the east of New Thalos. Simply follow the 
northern shore of the sea, and eventually you will find yourself there.
 
The legendary {yOlympus{x might also interest those wishing to explore the 
great cities of the realm. It is located to the northeast of Fayten, and can 
only be reached by those who can fly. Those who seek the city of Old 
Troya will find it by heading north from the entrance to Olympus, until 
they reach Zeus’ room and head down into the sea. The city itself is 
north through the battlefield.
 
Those who seek the city of {ySentua{x have a rather difficult path ahead of 
them, as they must head south into the river at the levee in Midgaard, 
then head straight east along the river and through a harsh desert called 
the Sands of Sorrow. It would be well-advised to bring plenty of water.
 
{yAarakocran City{x is an interesting place to visit, for those who aren’t 
afraid of flying. It can be reached by following the dwarf forest south 
of the crossroads until the valley in the forest, at which point you 
should head south and climb all the way to the top of the mountain, 
then head north and climb down a little way. This will lead you to 
Elemental Canyon. The entrance to the city is in the northeastern part 
of the canyon. One must be able to fly to reach it.
 
Finally, one of the more interesting towns to be found is located in the 
{yMirror of Realm{x. I am not familiar with the circumstances, but an 
ancient town seems to have been split in two, so that one side is held 
by the forces of light, while the other is ruled by the forces of darkness. 
It can be reached by heading north from the crossroads just east of 
Midgaard, and taking the second turn to the east.

map overrun darkness places~
This map is for the brave-hearted adventurers who would go to these 
cursed places and try to put an end to the evil there.
 
The {DUnholy Abbey{x can be found by going straight north of the 
crossroads just to the east of Midgaard’s eastern gate. Once you reach 
a point where you cannot continue, simply head east a few steps, then 
straight north again. A truly cursed place, beware the vile monks there.
 
The {DWestlands{x are a place ruled by a dark master, Darken Rahl. Those 
who wish to go there should head west of Midgaard until they see a 
colossal tree, and then follow the path north whenever possible.
 
The {DCaverns{x are a truly wretched place overrun by demons who have 
escaped from Hell. They can be reached by heading south of the 
crossroads to the east of Midgaard, and following the dwarf forest until 
the valley, at which point you should go north, and then take the first 
eastern turn. Head south, and then when possible, go all the way west 
until you encounter a wall, then head south again, and the entrance to 
the caverns will come into view. Once inside the caverns, {DHell{x is not 
very far off, for those who might wish to explore.
 
The {DAbyss{x is truly a horrific place, and quite dangerous. There are 
several ways to reach it, if you must go there. The first is to head west 
of Midgaard until the colossal tree, then heading taking a few steps to 
the northeast, and opening a secret door inside a large tree to the east. 
From there, head down into the depths of the tree, and south to reach 
the abyss. Another way is by following the dwarf forest until you reach 
the valley, then heading south, climbing the first level of the mountain, 
and then heading north.
 
There exists a town, who through some curse or misfortune has become 
a place where the undead walk day and night. The {DGhost Town{x lies very 
close to New Thalos, in the river about five blocks south of the Center 
Market Square. The entrance to the town lies just east and north of the 
New Thalos river’s shore.
 
{DCiquala's Lair{x is the home of a horrible lich, Ciquala. It can be reached 
by heading west of Midgaard until the colossal tree, and then heading 
northeast and entering another large tree. Once inside, head north, and 
descend into the darkness to find the lair.
 
{DThe Blight{x is a truly depressing place, a once beautiful land overrun by 
evil and disease. Those having business there should head straight north 
of the crossroads east of Midgaard, then take a few steps east, then north 
again and take the second turn to the west.
 
There is a {DMausoleum{x that can be accessed through the city of Midgaard. 
It can be reached by going into the basement of the Chapel that can be 
found south of a locked door on Elm Street. The mausoleum itself lies at 
the southern end of the maze of tunnels found beneath the chapel.
 
Finally, those with a courageous heart and quick reflexes may wish to 
brave the streets of the {DUnderdark{x. This city can be found by heading 
straight north of the crossroads east of Midgaard, and then opening a 
secret trapdoor once the way north is blocked.

There are many different races and cultures living close to Fayten, so 
this map is for those who wish to see how they live.
 
Those who wish to see the beauty of an elven city may wish to stop by 
{BArryndail{x, which is just a few steps north and west of where the road to 
Fayten begins in the plains.
 
Their cousins the Drow also have a city, though whether it can be called 
beautiful is up to interpretation. {BDrow City{x can be reached by following 
the dwarf forest until the valley, and then heading west and down into 
the caves.
 
A small {BGnome Village{x can be found by taking the first southern turn 
when heading west from New Thalos.
 
Some may be interested in seeing how the Minotaurs live. {BMahn-Tor{x can 
be found by following the dwarf forest until the valley, and then heading 
north and taking the eastern turn. After that, heading straight south 
whenever possible will eventually lead through the frigid wastelands to 
the gates of the city.
 
Though most people who encounter the goblins south of Midgaard in the 
{BMiden’nir{x would hardly think them civilized, they have set up a rather 
large village by the sea east of New Thalos. The {BGoblin Nation{x can be 
reached by heading as far east from New Thalos as possible, then heading 
south and east and following the river. Look for some reeds on the north 
shore.
 
Orcs have made their home in {BRotting Spine Village{x. A rather crude place, 
but for those who are interested, it is located at the first north turn when 
heading west out of New Thalos.

There are many towers scattered across the land, some of them very
beautiful. Any who wish to visit them will find this map useful.

The {CHigh Tower of Sorcery{x is rather difficult to get to, but a great place 
for those interested in the study of magic. Heading west of Midgaard, 
then south and west and following the forest trails will eventually take 
you to the Shadow Grove. The grove is a confusing place, but with luck 
you’ll find the tower. Another tower can also be found there, the {CDragon 
Tower{x, for those who wish to try their skills against such beasts. A 
strange place known as {CGalaxy{x is also accessible through the grove.
 
The {CLich Tower{x can by reached by following the dwarf forest until the 
valley, then heading north. Take the first turn to the east, then head south. 
The lich tower will be directly west from this point.
 
The {CWyvern’s Tower{x can be reached by heading to the valley in the 
dwarf forest, and going straight east from there. Rumours abound that 
great wealth lies there, though few have found anything.
 
The {CChess Tower{x can be reached by going north at the four way 
crossroad west of Midgaard, and then turning west.

own. Those who wish to know more might wish to visit some of the ones
suggested here.
 
{cDarknight Castle{x is an evil place that can be quite hostile to those who 
walk the path of light. It can be reached by taking the first northern turn 
west of Midgaard, and then the first western turn.
 
The {cKing’s Castle{x is located to the northeast of Fayten, between Olympus 
and Ofcol. It’s denizens are mainly law abiding, decent people.
 
The {cCastle of Giants{x can be found by following the dwarf forest into the 
valley, and then heading north whenever possible.
 
A lovely castle can be found in {cCamelot{x, where a good and kind-hearted 
king resides. It can be reached by traveling northeast of Fayten, beyond 
the foothills and the city of Ofcol.

map great forests realm~
We have a beautiful forest surrounding Fayten, but there are many more
to be found in the realms. To all those who love nature, I dedicate this
map, and hope it leads you to some new and exciting places to explore.
 
Probably the most well-known of the land’s forests, though most don’t 
know its true name. The {gForest of Nowhere{x can be reached by heading 
southeast of Fayten into the city of Midgaard, then west. It begins right 
outside of Midgaard’s western gate, and covers a quite a large area.
 
A few steps south of Midgaard, and a little to the west, lies {gEmerald Forest{x, 
a place filled with life. Though the nymphs and sprites there are friendly, 
the woods grow dark to the west, and become an evil place.
 
There is a forest close to Midgaard, located directly south of the first 
crossroads just to the east of the city. A rather gloomy place for the 
most part, it is known as the {gDying Forest{x. Much of the forest is overrun 
by creatures of darkness who seek its destruction, yet those who delve 
deeper find a glimmer of hope in the courage of the centaurs who give 
their lives to protect it.

One of the last forests left untouched by civilization, the {gVirgin Forest{x 
can be reached by two different routes. The first way is through the 
western end of the Dying Forest. The second is through the Forest of 
Nowhere.
 
The {gMagic Forest{x is like many others in these lands in that one part of 
it is beautiful and alive, while the other is tainted by evil. In order to 
reach it, head to the southeast of Fayten, into Midgaard, and then out 
through the western gate. Head directly west until you reach a 
colossal tree, then go north and east a few steps, until you spot a hill 
to climb up. After that, follow the path until the fork in the road. 
Taking the northern path will lead you right to the forest’s entrance.

map realm largest cities~
Though Fayten is the best city by far, there are many other towns and
cities that one could visit.

The city of {WMidgaard{x is Fayten’s closest neighbor, just to the southeast 
of town. It’s the most populated city to be found nearby, but it seems to 
have a rather high crime rate.

{WNew Thalos{x can be reached by heading southeast into Midgaard, and 
then going straight east.
 
{xThe city of {WOfcol{x can be found to the northeast of Fayten, in the rocky 
foothills.
 
The {WValley of the Titans{x is rather far, but not difficult to travel to. First 
head southeast into Midgaard, then head out the western gate and keep 
going until a colossal tree comes into view. To the northeast of the tree 
will be a hill, at the top of which is a long path. Follow the path until 
the fork in the road, then head west, and eventually the path will end at 
the entrance to the home of the giants.

{WDaleforn Valley{x doesn’t quite match these other cities in terms of size 
or population, but it truly is a quaint little town that everyone should 
visit at least once. It’s in the vicinity of the Emerald Forest; that is, it’s 
a few steps south of Midgaard’s southern gate, and then a few steps 
west and up a hill. The town can be found by continuing west where 
the path first forks.

Of course these cities are also reachable through the sky highway, for 
those with the ability to fly.

One final city to note, if it can even be called such, is {WOld Midgaard{x. It 
is truly a forsaken place, the home of necromancers and vampires. 
However, should there ever be a need to go there, let it be known that it 
lies beyond the void in the holy grove. The void can be reached by 
heading east of Midgaard and taking the third north turn along the 
eastern road. The void itself is rather difficult to navigate, but if done 
successfully, it will lead to a perversion of the past when Midgaard was 
under construction.

The Entrance to Fayten~
The gates that lead into the town of Fayten are wide enough to allow
several wagons to pass through together at one time. They seem to be
well-guarded, with armored men inspecting any who enter and leave
the city, doing their best to keep townspeople and travelers alike safe
and comfortable within the town. Tall stone walls surround the town,
occasionally broken by arrow slits, providing a good defense against 
would-be attackers.

their marble floors well-worn but polished. The road continues north

into town, ready to supply the shops and fortress, while others are headed 
out filled with goods bought from the local merchants. To the east are the 
barracks where Fayten’s guards live and train, while to the west lies the 
headquarters where guards are assigned their duties, and meetings are held

The Museum~
The museum is really one wide chamber, filled with strange and exotic 
displays as far as the eye can see. The exhibits range from pottery and 
sculptures to mystical artifacts whose purposes have long been forgotten. 
The floor is made of white polished stone, and high above, windows and 
a large skylight let in plenty of light, giving the museum an airy feel. 
Most of the items on display are kept in wooden stands and cabinets, 
encircled by thick white ropes to keep visitors at a safe distance. At 
the very center of the museum is the skeleton of an enormous dragon, a 
plaque placed before it.

At just over 50 feet long, this dragon must have been quite terrifying in 
its day. All that remains now are its bones, carefully put back together 
and on display for all to see. A thick white rope surrounds the dragon, 
preventing anyone from going near. A plaque placed before it tells its 
story.
 
       This dragon, named Riverflash by those who fought
       it, first made its presence known by attacking small
       fishing villages along Midgaard’s river. At that time,
       Midgaard was a tiny city-state, and its king decided
       to send his thousand man army after the beast,
       hoping to handle the problem without alerting his
       enemies to his kingdom’s weakened state.
 
       His army was devastated, crushed by Riverflash’s
       claws and tails and terrified by his power. Fear
       took over and discipline collapsed, with many of
       the soldiers turning to flee and being burned alive
       by the dragon’s breath. Only one man managed to
       maintain his calm during the battle, the Paladin
       Knight Taerol A’ddan. As his fellow soldiers died 
       all around him, he found his way close to the 
       dragon’s head, evading the sharp claws and
       narrowly escaping the dragon’s vicious bites.
       There he stood until finally the opportunity
       presented itself, and he lunged upward with his
       lance, driving it through the dragon’s throat. It
       is said that miles away, in the city of Midgaard,
       the dragon’s death cries could be heard, shaking
       the very earth.
 
       Here stands the skeleton of Riverflash, collected
       and put back together by the survivors left behind,
       to remind them of their lost countrymen and to
       honour Taerol A’ddan, who lost his life as the
       dragon fell.

The Museum~
The museum is really one wide chamber, filled with strange and exotic 
displays as far as the eye can see. In this section, ancient pottery,
cooking implements and crude weapons are on display, remnants of
some lost culture. Everything has an ancient feel to it, and the plaques
placed before the artifacts claim that many of these items are thousands
of years old. Most of the items on display are kept in wooden stands and 
cabinets, encircled by thick white ropes to keep visitors at a safe 
distance. At the very center of the museum is the skeleton of an 
enormous dragon, a plaque placed before it.

The Museum~
This section of the museum has been dedicated to the many objects of 
war that the people of the realms have created to fight each other. 
Swords created with the most modern of weapon-making techniques 
are placed side by side with crude stone axes and arrowheads, all 
testaments to the many wars and battles people have fought against 
each other since they began inhabiting these realms. One particular 
weapon catches your eye, a dagger placed in the center of the display, 
kept in a glass case and protected from theft by powerful magic.

dagger~
Though small, you can sense the power of this dagger right away. It 
glows a bright orange-red colour, as if the metal has just been 
removed from the fires from which it was forged. Before the dagger
is a plaque, explaining it’s origins.

         Here lies the evil dagger of Yag-Takush, slayer 
         of the innocent, destroyer of nations. Many died
         working for his defeat, and finally accomplished          
         it through an alliance of all the good peoples of
         the realm. This dagger is imbued with all of his
         hatred and malice, and many good souls have
         fallen to its blade, but it stands as a symbol of
         what can be accomplished when the good-hearted
         band together.

one, gently floating to the ground. The shade beneath this tree and the

The temple is surrounded by high walls of pale grey stone, which are 
covered with vines that climb along their sides. Small white flowers have 
been planted along the walls of the courtyard, adding some natural beauty 
to complement the temple’s architecture. The courtyard is fairly wide, 
and covered in freshly cut grass except for the cobblestone path that runs 
from the temple’s entrance back to the middle street. The temple itself is 
a large building, made of darker stone than the walls that surround it. Tall 
and intricate stained glass windows are visible from here, though it’s

The Entrance Hall of the Warlocks' Guild~
The air here crackles with mystical energy, summoned by the students of 
the guild as they practice their newly learned spells. To the north and west 
shelves are pushed up against the walls, every spare inch holding a book 
or a scroll. Tables and seats have been provided for the students who wish 
to study, and a small bar in the corner provides food and drink.

Books and scrolls are piled everywhere around this room. Some are 
placed neatly on shelves, while others are piled over chairs or up against 
the wall. The center of the room has been cleared, revealing a large blue 
circle where students can practice their new spells without fear of 
burning down the guild. In the corner is a large desk where the 
guildmaster sits, waiting to instruct his students.

The entrance to the witches guild is a small room with dark stone 
walls. The room is well-lit, though the source of the light is hard to 
determine. Strange objects are scattered throughout the room, 
brought by various members of the guild to be appraised by the 
guildmaster and to learn of their purpose. An arched door leads east 
to the main room where the guildmaster teaches her students.

The Scrying Pool~
The main room of the witches’ guild is circular in shape, with dark
stone walls. At the center of the room lies a shiny pool of water,
swirling around as if some force compels it. Blue balls of light float
back and forth across the room, providing the only light and giving
the room an eerie look. A tall stand is in the corner, on top of which
is placed a clear ball, about the width of a hand. The guildmaster
stands by the pool, peering into the water.

The grocer’s store is rather large, and the air here is cooler than outside. 
Several wooden rows have been placed along the walls, and some in the

vegetables. A counter at the far end of the room holds some fresh meat, 
some of it cooked and ready to be eaten. The air is sweet with the smell 
of fresh produce and roasting meat, all of it looking very appetizing.
A small sign hangs by the counter.

room. Several windows are opened to let in the fresh air from outside, but 
the tavern is still filled with the smell of smoke from the pipes of its 
patrons. It seems that the serving girls are being kept busy tonight; almost 
every single table is taken, and none of the ones close by are free. Every 
once in a while the door to the north swings open and a serving girl passes 
through, carrying a plate of hot food to a table or bringing dirty dishes 
back to the kitchen to be washed.

The Drawbridge~
A large wooden drawbridge stands over the wide moat that surrounds the 
castle. To the south lies a gate that leads into the town of Fayten, while to 
the north stands a large gatehouse, the entrance to the castle. From this 
vantage point it is possible to get a glimpse of the castle’s defenses. A 
large and deep moat makes scaling the walls or digging under them 
impractical, if not impossible. Arrow slits in the high castle walls allow 
the defenders to fire at any who dare attack while still having a good deal 
of cover. The drawbridge itself seems to be retractable, though one of the 
thick chains by which this is accomplished seems to have been damaged 
recently.

A raised portcullis leads into the gatehouse, which is well-guarded and 
serves as one of the main points of defense in the castle. Two towers flank 
the gatehouse, where archers can fire on those trying to approach by way 
of the drawbridge. Several chains and levers operate a pulley system that 
when operational can pull back the drawbridge in times of attack, which 
can then serve as a second gate. The entrance to the knight halls lies 
directly north, while narrow steps lead up to the castle walls, where the 
guards maintain a constant patrol.

broken every few feet by arrow slits that allow the defenders to see 
outside. A rope ladder leads up through a trapdoor, and murder holes

the heads of unlucky intruders. Currently all that can be seen is the

Along the Castle Walls~
The walls here are of the same dark grey stone as the rest of the 
castle, though they are bare of any tapestries or decorations and are 
broken every few feet by arrow slits that allow the defenders to see 
outside. To the east, beyond the moat and castle fortifications, wide 
plains can be seen, with tall mountains rising against the horizon.

The walls along the battlements are about four feet high, with sections 
that are lowered to allow archers to fire through while maintaining their 
cover. The view here is magnificent, with tall mountains straight ahead 
and a city visible in the distance among the foothills. Large metal pots 
stand ready to be filled with oil and heated up, and small holes in the 
floor allow the oil to be poured down into the hall, should attackers ever 
break through the castle’s defenses.

Before the Castle~
The walls here are of dark grey stone, with vibrant tapestries hung along 
the hall as decoration. There are no windows here, but ample light is 
provided by oil lamps hung from brackets in the walls, placed well away 
from anything flammable. The hallway itself is fairly wide, with a high 
ceiling and a hard cold floor that makes footsteps clearly audible. To the 
north lies the heart of the castle, where the knights have established 
themselves. To the south lies the gatehouse, the castle’s last room of 
defense before invaders can storm inside.

tapestries~
The tapestries here look expensive, and certainly are among the most 
beautiful to be found anywhere. Most are fairly simple, depicting 
animals or symbols used by Knights long dead to represent their name 
and deeds, while others represent famous battles or events in which the 
knights were victorious or performed great sacrifices to throw back the 
tides of darkness.

A Turn in the Road~
The wide road takes a turn to the north, where the tall stone walls of a 
town come into view. The town looks fairly large, and there seems to be 
a good deal of traffic heading in and out of the town through wide gates 
that look to be under guard. Several small paths branch off from the main 
one, leading to farmhouses and land in the surrounding area. To the east
the road continues, heading towards the plains.

The Road to Fayten~
The small path running through the plains gradually comes to be replaced 
by a wide road paved with stones, running in a northwesterly direction. 
Wagon tracks along the road reveal that it is well used, but nevertheless in 
good condition. The land here gradually becomes more forested to the 
west, with large trees growing along the side of the road providing shade 
for weary travelers. To the east a wide plain can be seen, leading to some
rocky foothills.
