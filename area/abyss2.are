Center Street~
The center street is a wide, dark road.  This street is probably one of
the brighter places in the town, but it is still fairly dark out and hard to
see long distances.  The air is active with hawkers cries and the pound of a
hammer on an anvil, and muffled screams are audible in the distance.  The
road is paved with thick stones meant to withstand any amount of walking and
heavy wagon wheels without sustaining damage.

city.  Every once in a while one of them tries to enter the inner city, but

Main Street~
The main street is a skinny, dull road.  It is paved with round
cobblestones that are slippery in the cold, and highly durable.  The road
carries with it the cries of hawkers and merchants, as well as men and woman
yelling for others to get out of their way.  The street is lined with
buildings, some tall, some short, most dark.  In several places the street
is intersected by alleys and other streets, none as large as the one you
travel.

The East Gate of {DShodar Haran{x~
The west gate of shodar haran is made up of two enormous wooden doors
that are easily twice as tall as any storm giant.  The doors are covered in
thick iron and outward-facing spikes, and is covered in many dents from
previous siege attempts.  Inside the gate you can see the main street of the
town, a narrow, dark road full of people and activity.

well as a rack on the wall holding numerous weapons.  The dark stone walls
provide little insulation, the room is quite cold.

Entering this room, you are immersed in a thick {Mfog{x wafting from the
tops of numerous cauldrons.  The sides of the room are covered in small
wooden shelves, which in turn are heavily laden down with potions, wands,
scrolls and other magical items.  The smell of the place is quite
disgusting, a mix of bat guano, rat's tails, newt's fingers, etc.

The Dice Store~
The dice story is a shabby little building covered in dice cups and dice
ranging from some old beaten dice you suspect were found in the trash to a
set of gleaming gilded dice and cup.  The counter behind which the store
owner stands is at the east end of the shop a thick length of warped wood
that looks like it was stuck together at the last minute.  The rooms smells
strongly of old leather and flies, but not much smells good in this part of
town.

Kallion's Knives~
One of Shodar Haran's several knife stores, this place is most likely the
most murderous.  The knives aren't first rate, several are rusty and
notched, but they all have very keen edges.  Definitely handiwork of
Kallion, the store's owner, who sits behind the counter sharpening a knife
and licking his lips.

A Dusty {yHayloft{x~
So you thought you could escape paying rent by sleeping in the hayloft? 
Think again...  It seems the innkeeper has a grudge against some folk who
try to sleep here for free and evade notice...

The Stables~
The floor of this room is covered in {yhay{x, and reeks of horse dung. 
The few stalls in the corner are empty, as it is unlikely that anyone in
this part of town is wealthy enough to own a horse.

A Landing~
Climbing the unsturdy stairs up to the second floor of the inn, you
notice that the peeling walls are completely bare except for one odd-looking
portrait at the top of the landing.  The floor is uncovered wooden boards,
and they creak noisily, reducing the chance for any sneakiness.

The leather shop produces a large variety of clothing and tools out of
leather, and various specimen hang from the walls.  There are several

The entryway to this mansion is a wide hall, probably wide enough for two
wagons moving abreast of each other.  The cavernous cathedral ceiling towers
over you, a good thirty feet up, and two oil lamps struggle to fend off the
darkness.

The main room of the mansion is even larger than the entryway, and filled
with what was once fashionable furniture.  The couches and armchairs are
motheaten and dusty, and the few remaining tapestries on the walls are
charred or ripped.  The glass cases found in several niches along the wall
have been broken, and their goods stolen.  Several dark stains linger on the
carpet, and the whole room smells of death.

This cellar is like any you have seen before, except there is a feeling

death.  Quite odd after all.

A Run-down House~
The run-down house you have entered is dully lit by several candles and
an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling.  There is a fair amount of furniture,
a couch in one corner and a table in the other, several chipped wooden
chairs surround the table.  The floor is bare stone, and the lone window
offers a glum view of scythe street.  The room smells sweet, bitter and sour
all at the same time, mixed in with a scent that can only be described as
herbal or earthy.

The Outfitter~
This store, oddly named "the outfitter" is covered from wall to wall in
moth-eaten rags.  The owner, a toothless old man, smiles happily at his
collection of old discarded clothes.  The room smells of old leather and
mold, it's quite unpleasant.

Clement's Clothing~
This store contrasts greatly from the outfitter's just down the street,
hanging from pegs on the walls are finely tailored suits, some with
embroidered lapels and collars.  Despite the prestigious clothes, the store
isn't quite as rich.  The floor is barely covered in mismatched mats, and
the five oil lamps lighting the room give off a nasty smell.

The Dicing Hall~
The dicing hall is a very long building packed with small round tables. 
A slim serving girl meanders through the tables, offering drink to the
gamblers.  The unpolished wooden floor is slippery with spilled liquid and
muck tracked in from the patrons' shoes.  A stage in the back of the room is
for entertainers, and is often watched by customers tired of gambling.

{rScythe{W Street{x~
Walking along scythe street, you can think of two reasons for how it got
it's name.  It could be because of the shape of the street how it is long
and then curves to the side, or it could be named scythe street because of
it's notorious reputation as a murder hotspot.  The second is backed up by
an astounding amount of bloodstains on the ground, as well as other random
garbage.

trash and dirt, and scythe street is just off to the west.  You see a small
ladder leading up the building.

Atop the Dicing Hall~
The rooftop is swathed in moonlight, and seems to glow slightly.  The
roof is stone like the rest of the building, and made slippery from rain and
grime.  Off to the south you can see the main street, to the east you can
see the inner wall, and to the north all is dark.

A Field of Dead Grass~
The grass of this field was once probably knee-high and bright green, but
now the shoots are brittle and dull yellow, and crack and crunch noisily
beneath your feet.  The field stretches on for a ways in every direction,
and is unperturbed except for a very large tree at the northern end.

The Base of a Large Tree~
The tree you stand beneath is very large, it towers above you for a good
fifty paces.  As the branches shoot out from higher and higher up on the
trunk, it is more difficult to discern what lies up there, but it seems odd
that such a large tree would be here with no purpose.

In the Tree~
Climbing further up the tree, you are enclosed in a wall of branches and
leaves, mostly dead ones.  The air smells of sap and bark, and through the
branches you can see the inner wall of the city off to the east.

Out on a Branch~
Far out on an eastern branch of the tree, you can see the west shodar
wall within easy reach.  Hidden behind a screen of leaves and branches, the
guards will most likely not notice you.  You can go back to the trunk of the
tree, or try to hop unnoticed onto the wall.

The Top of the Tree~
You have reached the top of the tree, and the view is utterly astounding.
The city extends off to the south and east, a maze of dark alleys and large
stone buildings, all covered in darkness.  The cityfolk down on the main
streets are mere specks, although you can make out the statue in the Dalath
square quite easily.  Oddly enough, a small rope bridge extends off of the
tree to the west.

A niche here is carved out of the huge stone blocks in the west outer
wall.  The air is cool and refreshing, away from the bustle of the city, it
is a very nice spot indeed.  Off to the south and north, strange doors are
carved into the wall.

The shelter is a small room that consists mainly of a very long counter,
and a great many beggars.  Several aproned cooks are bustling about the
room, preparing dishes for the buffet, which seems to be free for the
beggars!  The room would probably smell good, if it weren't for the sweaty,
unwashed scent of the numerous beggars and refugees.

one is slightly larger yet equally stuffy.  The walls are lined with staves
and scrollcases and scrolls as well, and there are many glass cases full of
strange powders and enchanted objects.  The owner of the store, a greedy
little gnome, smiles happily at you.

The tall walls, straight on the inside despite being shaped on the outside,
are a good ten paces apart from each other.  Lining the walls are ancient
carvings depicting black-garbed assassins scaling walls and murdering
victims with their bare hands, and pictures of tanto knives, shurikens, and
sharp katanas.  A rope ladder leads upwards to the top of the statue, while
there is a trapdoor leading below.  {x

the assassins that stay here.  A circular counter of dark wood follows the
walls along, and is neatly polished.  The floor is completely trackless,
there are no traces of people being in this room at all.  Only two small
tables of dark wood are in the room, for there would not be enough room for
more.  The walls are carved with tanto knives, shurikens and katanas just
like the entrance, as well as a symbol of a fist.  {x

intervals on the walls, several still have shurikens embedded in them.  A
few upper bodies of practice dummies are on wooden posts in one end of the
room, although their wooden necks have been broken many times.  In the
center of the room is a large sparring mat for fist-fighting matches, and
the floor is slick with blood.  {x

Syntax: sneak

A sneaking character is able to enter and exit rooms without being seen
by both players and monsters, though monsters will notice them some of the
time.  While sneaking, characters are able to pick up or drop items, and
perform a few other actions without being observed.

0 0 shuriken~
Shuriken is a ninja art mastered long ago, yet not rediscovered until
recently.  A ninja may attack his foe stealthily from far distance with the
small, bladed ninja-stars, inflicting painful gashes.  To throw a shuriken
you must be holding one in your hand, and you must not be wielding a weapon.

Since a shuriken is light weight, it doesn't travel very far.  Thus
the effective range of this skill is limited to the next room.

Wild swing is a warrior technique involving a quick burst of spinning, where
the warrior swings his or her weapon as he or she spins. All persons in
the current room will most likely taste the warrior's blade, but
the warrior might become dizzy or drop his or her weapon.

{CSyntax: write <objectname>{x

You may {Rwrite{x on {Rparchment{x type objects that are in your
inventory, it is similar to writing a note or description.  To view what has
been written on the object, simply {Rlook{x at it.  Some parchment objects
have different characteristics, it may only be able to be written on once,
or it may not be able to be picked up once it is dropped.  You can use these
for whatever you wish, post letters that cannot be picked up at the entrance
to a clan you wish to join, or create copies of a newspaper to sell to any
that want it.  Have fun with this but please--don't abuse the ability and
write vulgar things, and do not write things that are out of character, the
write ability is completely in character.  
 
To read a parchment, you can look or read it if it is in the ground, or
examine it if it is in your inventory or on the ground.
~
0 0 SLING~
Thieves learn the ability to sling daggers at foes from a room away.  To
do so, they must have at least one hand free and a dagger in their 
inventory.
 
Upon a successful strike, the dagger has a chance of lodging itself in 
the victim's leg, thus giving him a small jolt of pain with every movement.
