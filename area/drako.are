Storm giant Paladin Squire~
A giant Storm Giant is here guarding the Citadel halls from intruders.
~
Before you stands a grand sight, towering about 15 feet into the air, is a storm giant paladin.  He is wearing brilliant white armor, that is etched with runes you can not completely understand.  You also see a very long sheath drapping from his side.
He looks down at you, realizing that you are not one of this area, he watches you carefully.  His hand goes down to his sword, and his face goes cold, waiting for you to prove yourself good ...or evil.

A gigantic man of a man stands here looking very unsatisfied

Towering over you at an astonishing seven feet eight inches tall you see
a "HUGE" human man.  His body is covered with muscles and those muscles with
muscles.  His hair is unkempt but in a pony tail atop his head.  His skin
looks to be as raw hide and as dark as the darkest mud.  His eyes seem to
burn with the fury of a thousand demons attempting to break the gates of
hell.  He carries a massive warhammer in one hand and a second one just as
large in the other.

Inzhurthia The Foul, Lich Lord of Hell~
A Flaming Spirit desecrates the very land beneath him with unholy fervor.
~
Flames envelope and surround this undead beast in a caress much as a
mother would give to her child.  More than surrounds it, the fires rage even
within him, as they blaze even within its empty eye-sockets.  There is no
flesh upon this thing, nor tissue or tendon.  The becomming has kept him
animate to live in pain for centuries within the fiery inferno.  What
disaster has led this being of pure hatred into the mortal world was surely
great, as the power of the Lich Lord is rivaled by none save the sons of
Satan themselves.

Before the gates of Drako Village~
You stand before the gates of what looks like a modest farming community.
The gates are rather large and rather sturdy for farming.  The gates reach
to twenty feet tall and are made from Tika wood, braced and strengthened
with Adamantite bars, and Mithril bolts.  Pounded into the metal on the door
and etched in the overhead is a picture of a very large dragon that shines a
Midnight black.

moving about from place to place.  You see an alley leading to the east and
west, It looks rather dark and dirty.  Might not be a good idea to venture
them alone.  The streets are cobbled with medium sized stones, dirt and
animal droppings.  The buildings at the edge of the streets are rather small
and modest, and only contain one or two windows at the most.

people going quickly to their destinations.  To the south you can see the
large gates and the beginning of Main Street.  As you look high above the
wall to the north you notice a very large mountain that is as black as
midnight and as shiny as obsidian stone.  To the east you can feel the heat
and hear the clanging of metal on metal from the blacksmith's forge.  To the
west you can hear the clanging of metal on metal and the grunts of what
sounds like a very large man coming from the weaponsmith's forge.

seems to be bearable for a short time.  You notice many fine pieces of armor
of different kinds on the wall, and stacked on the floor in the corners. 
Next to the southern wall is the HOT forge where the blacksmith is working
hard on a human sized breastplate.  The blacksmith notices you, puts down
his hammer dips the breastplate in water and walks over to you smiling.

Weaponsmith~
You see what looks like a giant that was cut off at the knees standing in
front of a large forge with a large anvil.  He is banging away at a large
piece of metal slowly forming it into a blade for a two handed sword You
notice many many large weapons hanging on the walls and from the ceiling
joists.  There are some large hammers leaning in the corners and an extremly
large chest on the back wall covered with a blanket.  The forge is very HOT
and his hammer is very loud.  You feel you can bear it for a little while. 
The weaponssmith notices you standing at his counter after a minute and
walks over holding his hammer in one hand still.  He smiles showing you he
is missing three of his front teeth.

You notice to the south there are some small fields with crops, and people
harvesting them.  To the south on the eastern side of the road you see some
small farm houses with children playing outside while the adults and older

Dirt road near some crop fields~
To the south on the eastern side of the road you see some small farm
houses with children playing outside while the adults and older kids tend
the fields on the western side of the dirt road.  Every so often there is a
mule harnessed to a cart loaded with the days harvest.  The children notice
you and run into their houses peeking out from behind the door giggling at
you.  Why?

The Begining of a small dirt road~
You step softly and slowly through this alley all the while the hair on
the back of your neck standing up.  You think you see something in the

good idea to turn back now while you still can.  Before you turn and leave
you notice some small fields of crops to the north on the western side of
the dirt road, on the eastern side you can see some small farm houses with
children playing in front of them.

The Depths of Hell~
This room looks like it takes up the entire inside of the mountain.  The
cieling is so high you almost can not see it.  The room reachs a width of
nearly one hundred and fifty men across All around the room you see
mountains of gold coins, silver coins and jewels some extremly rare, some
magical and some are uncut and un polished.  You can see armor from many
lands along with weapons beside the armor, inside the armor you can see the
skeletons of those that used it previously.  In the center of the room on
top of the largest pile of treasure you can barely make out an enormous
shadowy form.  As you slowly approach the large pile of treasure, the
shadowy figure lifts its head and roars so loud that large rocks rain down
upon your nearly smashing you to death.  You notice the shadowy figure is
The Dragon Lord, oldest of the dragon race and the largest.  He lunges

Before the entrance to Drako Village~
As you trudge along the mountain path, a village slowly comes into view.
It seems to be a rather strange place for farmers to live, this high up in
the mountains -- but here and there, you see a few fields of crops tucked
among the boulders and bluffs of the mountains.  Why would anyone want to
try their hand at farming way up here?  You look around a bit more, and
there seems to be pockets of mist or smoke also coming out from between the
rocks.  Amongst the rocks you see one that sticks out and grabs your
attention. This stone looks rather odd here and out of place.

letter~
This letter was written in an ancient language which makes it impossible
to read.  You touch the letters and they begin to swirl and change colors. 
They resettle in your own language and now you can read this ancient letter.
To all adventurers who may visit this place, My name is {DGrollnark
Stonefist{x, I came to this village in search of evil to slay in the realms.
I had heard of a great evil in this village that was consuming all around
it.  Being the last of my kind and the last of my brothers of the
Brotherhood of the Battle Mages.  I came here to stop this evil from
consuming the world.  When I got here this village it was in shambles and
nearly ruined.  There was a Great {MMidnight{x colored dragon sitting atop
the old ruined keep, he was roaring and breathing fire at the charred corpse
of what I could only guess was the Former king of this once great village. 
I set it upon myself to take care of this greate evil.  I fought the dragon
for many days and many nights before finally I found a way to bind the
dragon since I would not defeat him.  I called upon some servitors from
other planes to guard this village and to guard the entrance to the tunnel
that held this great evil.  His is bound in a room deep under the mountain. 
The servitors I have called to this place helped the villagers to repair
thier village and rebuild the keep.  In time a new king and queen was chosen
and Law and Order was restored to this pleasant village.  To gain entrance
this this great village you must speak this phrase in the presence of the
elemental at the gates.  
I have come to destroy the Midnight Dragon!
 
When you speak this phase he will allow you inside the village.

Path leading toward a Glowing Citadel~
Taking a causious step towards the strange light, you see that you have
arived upon a path.  Up ahead of you, in the distance you see what appears
to be a grand citadel.  As you squint your eyes to get a better look you
realize that the citadel is glowing with a strange light.  One that does not
seem familiar to you in any way.  You are drawn near it, and yet you feel
that this might not be some place that you want to tread near, if you are

Crossroads of a Divine Path~
You scan the area, to the north you see the Glowing Citadel, whose light
you have been following this far.  It now appears that it is almost directly
above you in the sky.  You look around and find that the path cuts different
directions.  To the east and west you see what appear to be rooms.  You are
not sure what or who could be in these rooms.  But remembering the strange
light, you do not care as much, and continue on your way.

As you move farther north, you realize that the path has not been sloping
toward the Glowing Citadel as much as you had hoped.  From here you can tell
that the Citadel is directly above you, but you think that you can sense a
magical path going upword.  As you try to climb upon the path you realize
that the strange light is starting to affect ur judgement for there there is
nothing there to step on.

After the feeling of calm passes you, you are able to see the path once

voice is there, it has passed and you are on your way once again.

you slip and fall.  You think to yourself, "I suppose humility is a virtue,"
and continue on your way.

Hallway~
Proceding through the open door you make a remarkable descovery.  The
inside of this great keep is as humble as the outside is brillant.  The
walls look to be at one time painted with a whiteish color, but have long
since shown the effect of time.

Hallway~
As you procede through the hallway, you see many tourches lining the
wall.  You think that you see symbols or even letters on the wall, if you
look closer you might be able to make them out.  You eventully choose to
procede north through the now well lit hallway.

E
wall~
There are very strange runes, lining the walls to this place.  Not many
of them are of a language you can read, let alone hope to understand.  There
are a few pictures that seem to make sense to you.  There is what appears to
be a giant paladin fighting against a troll anti paladin.  You come to the
conclusion that these runes represent the age old conflict between the
forces of light, and the forces of darkness.

Hallway before the Intersection~
Just ahead of you, you see the hallway splitting into three different
directions.  Up until now this place has given you little choice in your
course of actions.  But now it seems as though you will have to make a
choice.  This leap of faith could be the one that saves your life, or
destories it...

Intersection of Faith~
This place has an errie feel to it, like you have been here before.  As
you look in all directions the flames start to die out, and it is impossible
for you to be sure of where you are going.  You feel strange forces pulling
on you, a feeling of holyness pulls you toward the north, a feeling of
hatred pulls you somewhat to the west, and from the east you feel nothing at
all.  You must think carefully, the thing that rides on you the most, is the
lack of anything from the east...

Path of Nothingness~
You go off the path to the east, and there is utter nothingness.  There
is no torches on the wall, but yet it is not dark either.  Even the air
seems to hold completely still, as if in some kind of strange balance.  You
just want to stay here forever, in perfect balance with the world.

Path towards Perfect Balance~
For the first time since choosing this path, you actully start to feel
something.  You are not quire sure what it is, but the room to the east
looks like it would be very accomidating to all those who enter.  You allow
yourself to move that way, ever so gracefully.

well making it darker not only in feeling but in reality as well.  You

strange markings on the stairs that you previously saw on the walls, but non
of these are pictures, and there is nothing that you can decipher.

giant paladin staring back at you.  With the magnitude of his greatness you
also expect to see a great throne, but instead you see a simple prayer rug
laying on the ground, which assume this paladin uses this rug to pray to the
holy god, Thorel.  The room is filled with a very refreshing aura, and just
as you are about to leave, he smiles slightly and asks you if you have seen
the Anti Paladin at all.

description~
With a gruff beard and a large pock marked nose on his face you see a
stout and very large dwarf.  His eyes look like pieces of black coal, they
burn with fierceness that only his enemy knows.  This dwarf's skin is tough
and very dark from years of service to the forge.  His body is much larger
than a normal dwarf's body.  He stands at a towering five feet four inches
tall.  His hair is long and reaches the end of his back His beard is the
same length as his hair.  He keeps both hair and beard neatly braided into
small braids which are then braided into one large braid.  He keeps his hair
kept together with small iron clasps.  At the base of his beard you see a
large symbol which depicts a hammer striking a piece of red hot mithril upon
an anvil.  In one of his hands he carries an axe, and in the other a hammer
of sorts.  You also notice that:

A small chamber.~
You are standing in a small chamber outside a dark corridor.  There are a
few bone like materials scattered across the floor here.  On the walls you
can barely recognize a pitiful attempt at a message scratched in with a
sharp stone.  You can leave through the door to the north.

you as you contemplate your actions.

Beginning of a strange passage way.~
You are standing in a stange passage way.  Looking at the walls you see
large claw shaped grooves thatun alsong the entire passage.  Off in the
distance you can just make out those agonizing screams you heard earlier
over the sound of rushing water.

marks~
Looking at the wall you can plainly see large claw marks that run several
inches deep down the entire passage.  Just the thought of meeting the
creature that made these would make any average person insane with terror.

A blocked corridor.~
As you exit the room above you the sound of the water grows fainter
though the screams only seem to get louder.  The screams seem to be coming
from somewhere to the east.  To the west the corridor is blocked by huge
stones.

west~
Apparently there was a small cave in that has rendered the west part of
the passage inpassable.  Upon closer expection it seems entirely possible
that the cave in was no accident...
