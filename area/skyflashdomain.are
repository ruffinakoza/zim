a beautiful oriental woman~
A beautiful oriental woman sits at a loom.
~
She's a human woman around the ages of 30, who's clearly spent her entire
life learning how to make the most perfect silk she can.  Her hands move
with speed and skill, and her face betrays her intense concentration on the
duties before her.

lord skyflash~
the lord of Skyflash~
The nameless, timeless lord of Skyflash rests here.
~
The rulership of Skyflash is passed down from heir to heir, but not
necessarily by birth; lords, when they are crowned, must pick the person
they wish to succeed them.  When they are crowned, they undergo a glorious
religious rite that leaves them a completely different person; their
features are changed to mimic that of the eternal lord, and their
distinctive characteristics and mannerisms are erased.  Thus, the lord is
released of all previous identity and bonds, and becomes the next in the
line of nameless rulers of Skyflash.  This is the fourteenth ruler.

a gateguard~
A gateguard of Skyflash leans against the wall, relaxing.
~
Guards of this city-state lead a pretty calm existence, since they live
on a floating island...  Not many armies can attack this place.  They just
relax, joke around, and generally have a good time.  There's a small sign
near where he's standing; it says: "If you need assistance with the gate,
just ask the gateguard:

'Can you unlock the gate?'"

A rougher sort of guard than the average of Skyflash, he's more muscular
and less social than the typical.  Seems his group has picked up a nasty
habit. He's standing next to a small sign. It reads:
 
"If you need assistance with the gate, please simply as the guard,
'Can you unlock the gate?'"

A rugged man of his mid-40s, he seems well-traveled and very tough.  He
blends into his surroundings very well, seemingly by accident.  He's managed
to make this dwelling inside this tree without harming the tree itself,
which is quite a feat.

The smuggler is a very thin man in his late 20s.  With sharp features and
a bird-like sneer, he glances you over and sizes you up.  He makes his
living off of illegal imports and exports, and feels no shame in what he
does for profit.  The rulers of Skyflash have worked hard to track him down,
but to no avail.

his late 50s, though his aging doesn't look natural.  He has a thin, gray
beard down to his waist, and a black robe encompassing his wiry frame. 
Surrounded by candles, he chants and waves his arms to and fro, invoking
god-knows-what.

trickles down his back, and an out-dated, frayed wardrobe from centuries ago
covers the majority of his pale yellow skin.

the same time.

soon as you enter the room.  Among his traditional weapons are more sadistic
implements of distruction, such as whips and sourges.  You see he carries a
hammer and a set of nails with him, suggesting he is ready to crucify good
anywhere at any time.

An imposing figure at nearly 7 feet tall, he's one of the few remaining
holy crusaders of the early holy wars of Skyflash.  After the great ascent,
the need to defend the land from evil diminished greatly, and the ranks of
the order have dwindled significantly.  One of a handful, he still takes his
duties very seriously, and would gladly lay down his life for his lord.

with great speed from one end of the kitchen to the other, trying to make
everything just right, but he doesn't seem to ever actually DO anything. 
Instead, he tells his servants what do do.

Edge of a Cliff~
You are standing on the very edge of a cliff.  Below you, thousands and
thousands of feet down, you can see the forests of the lands far west of
Midgaard.  You feel an overwhelming sense of vertigo, and immediately step
back from the edge.  Surrounding this clearing to the north, south and west,
is a thick and lush forest; to the west, you see a path barely kept from
overgrowth.  
 
You see a sign nearby. It says:

Path in the forest of Skyflash~
You are wandering down a path on the floating island of Skyflash.  The
birds are very loud and plentiful here, but you have yet to see any sort of
non-avian lifeform.  You wonder whether or not there are any; perhaps the
noise you hear to the west is just your imagination.  To the east and west,
the path continues.

Path in the forest of Skyflash~
You are wandering down a path on the floating island of Skyflash. 
There's an amazing amount of sound coming from everywhere around you, but it
seems to all be from wind or birdcalls.  You still think you hear some sort
of distant humanoid voice from the west, but you can't be sure.  The path
continues to the east and west.

of berry bushes and fruit trees they can feast upon on this strange floating

you see some sort of man-made structure.

You are standing at the gates of a wall; behind them looks to be a city. 
The forest doesn't extend beyond the wall, except for a tree here or there. 
Looks like it was cleared, and the wall was put up to keep it from growing
in again.  To the east, a path goes off into the wilderness.

Inside the Gates of Skyflash~
You are standing inside the gates of the city of Skyflash.  It must be
strange, living on a small floating continent; the days must seem longer. 
It also seems unusually warm here; perhaps being closer to the sun accounts
for the tropical environment.  To the west, a street stretches towards a
palace, with small shops and houses lining it.  To the east, through the
gates, a small path disappears into the wilderness.

are confirmed when you read the shop signs: "The Taste of Teshubu" to the
north, and "The Spinning Dragon" to the south.  The scent of delicious
eastern food comes from the north, and you hear the distinct sounds of a bar
to the south.  To the west, the street continues, with more shops lining it.

The Taste of Teshubu~
You are standing inside a small eastern-looking restaraunt.  Behind a
counter, a man you presume to be Teshubu grills and fries and bakes things
in a small kitchen.  There are a couple chairs nearby, but you get the
impression that this place is take-out, rather than dine-in.  To the south,
you see Lilac Street.

laugh and drink their alcohol around you, and the room certainly seems to
have the scent of a liquor establishment.  Behind the counter, a bartender
of the arial race handles all drink requests.  He carries a katana, and
looks very tough; it seems that fights break out pretty frequently here.

flowers and fragrences assaults you.  Incense burns in atleast four places,
and behind the counter, the man you assume is Fu-Shu Su as at work crushing
a lilac flower for it's juice.  Bins of strange pills and vials line the
walls; the only whole flower you see for sale is a red rose, and even they
strike you as odd, though you aren't sure why.  A door behind the counter
reads, "Arcanes Only."

little use in dolling the place up.  To the west, you see Lotus Street.

north you see a door; inside, you hear what sounds like the cries of someone
being tortured, along with laughter.  To the east lies another door, behind
which you hear what sounds like someone sawing something in half, along with
the dripping noise of what sounds like blood.

Back Room~
You are standing inside the back room of the flower shop.  Strewn about
are crates and crate of random arcane objects and foci; there's a crate of
scrolls here, a crate of potions there, a crate of pills there.  It's truly
an amazing sight.  To the east and west are doors; behind the east you hear
sounds you'd hear in a kitchen, and from the west come sounds of chanting.

You are standing inside what can only be described as a 'kitchen from

the center of the room takes from freely; toad eyes, chicken feet, goat

You are standing inside a room filled with strange arcane symbols and

candles and marked with white dust.  All around the room are small altars to

he is working on building a flesh golem.  Corpses and body parts lie strewn
about, while he saws off what he doesn't want and sews what he does onto his

you don't need to breathe, because you're a vampire.  A coffin sits in a
corner, and a small table and chair sit in the center of the room.  A simple
lamp gives off a small amount of light, just enough to write to.  A pen and
ink sit on the table; perhaps he's an author as well as a cursed

even it's founder.  To the north and south, the balcony extends and wraps
around the hall.  Doors from the balcony exit into the north and south wings

The painting appears to be of an arial holding a scroll in one hand, and

he's has some visible text refering to the Bushido.

would have a child, it'd always be a black-feather, and for some unknown
reason, the grey-feathers were unable to have children with eachother.

of the Crusaders of Lode.  Many of the crusaders stand looking on; it seems

Ascended, And We Will Fall, But We Will Always Know Who We Are."

This one seems to be a depiction of the great flight, a migration from
the island that happened about a century ago.  Skyflash had become
overpopulated, so many of it's residents were forced to find homes on the
earth below.  People are seen leaping from the edge of the island and
soaring away from it towards their new earthly homes, with their meager
possessions in their hands.

lord stands above them, side by side with the last remaining crusader hero,
looking on in sadness, and a single tear trickles down his cheek.  Below the
painting, an inscription reads, "{WThe Lode Relics{x were sealed away when
there was no longer a need.  They silently wait for their call into arms on
the fateful day they're summoned again."  
~
E
painting north wall~
This one seems to depict the attack of the Hunters, a legendary event
that took place centuries ago.  Allegedly, a raid was conducted by the
Hunter (now known as Shadow) clan to take everything in the city that wasn't
nailed down.  The people of Skyflash had become so accustomed to isolation
that they had let their guard down, and weren't prepared for the onslaught;
however, the Crusaders of Lode and the ruler himself were able to defend and
repel the attacking force before anything significant was taken.

ruler must have many high-profile guests at a time.  Skyflash has always
been a good place for warring kings to meet to negotiate a peace, since it's
hard for anyone without flight to get there; many assassins can't fly.  Go
figure.

You continue down the hallway.  Honestly, you're feeling a bit sick of
hallways; you feel like this palace has far too many of them.  Perhaps thats
what the workers who built this palace also felt; it seems like this wing
was more hastily constructed than the others.  The hallway continues east
and west, and there's yet another door to the south.

The End of the South Wing~
You are standing at the western end of the hallway of the southern wing. 
Seems you've come to the last guest bedroom to see; looking through the
keyhole, it appears to be the ...  Guest bathroom?  Wow, the ruler seems to
treat his guests well.  The hallway stretches east, back towards the
balcony.

The {RRed{z Guest Room~
You're standing inside a guest bedroom of the palace.  This room seems to
have a distinct {Rred{z theme; the carpet is red, the walls are painted red,
and there's a red piano in the corner.  The whole vibe is a little strange,
but very interesting.  To the north there's a door leading back out to the
hallway.

The {BBlue{z Guest Room~
This particular guest bedroom has a distinct {Bblue{z theme; blue
bedsheets, blue walls, and a blue chair sitting next to an as-yet-unpainted
canvas.  The vibe is pretty calm, if a bit sparse.  The bed looks
comfortable, and you consider a nap without even thinking about it.  To the
north, a door leads back into the hallway.

This room, like the others, has it's own colored theme; this one happens
to be {ggreen{z.  Green chairs, green walls, a green amoir, and other green
objects litter the space; even the carpet is green.  It reminds you faintly
of the forest.  To the north, a door leads out into the hallway.

The {YGolden{z Guest Room~
You are standing in what appears to be a {Ygold{z-themed guest bedroom. 
This one, unlike the others, has a very rich feel to it; the candleholders,
the lantern, the mirror, they're all made out of or atleast trimmed in gold.
There's got to be thousands of gold pieces worth of the raw material here,
but they're all on objects far to heavy for you to carry out without someone
noticing.  Oh well; you can atleast still get a nice nap.

The {mPurple{z Guest Room~
You are standing inside the {mpurple{z-themed guest room.  Having seen
the others, you are no longer surprised; it follows the same pattern: purple
carpet, purple bedsheets, and a purple desk and chair.  You get a slightly
rich vibe from this room; the objects in it seem more expensive than the
objects of the others, save for the {Ygolden{z room.  The door to the north
leads back out into the hallway.

You are standing inside the guest bathroom. A simple bathtub has been placed in the center of the room, and a small stove sits on the eastern wall for heating water. To the south is the sink, and to the west is the toilet. Towels of assorted colors hang from the walls; at least everyone should know which is there's. The door to the north leads back out to the hallway.

The Master Foyer~
You are standing inside the foyer of the master bedroom.  Here, a small
chair sits, presumably for the guard that is supposed to stand at the
entrance and protect the ruler and his bride.  To the east, through an
entranceway, the master bedroom extends into a massively wide space, filled
with beautiful pieces of art and comfortable-looking furniture.  It
certainly seems nicer than any place you've slept.

You are standing inside the master bedroom of the ruler of Skyflash. 
Beautiful art-objects lie strewn about; golden candle holders,
leather-backed chairs, and a beautiful cherry-wood bed with silken covers. 
To sleep here would be a luxury unimaginable.  To the west is the foyer of
the bedroom, and to the east you see a door with what you think must be the
bathroom.

center of the room, a large claw-foot bathtub sits, awaiting anyone who
wants a nice bath.  On the eastern wall is a stove to heat the water, and a
sink sits on the southern wall.  The northern wall got the tail end of the
deal: the toilet (no pun intended, of course).  The master bedroom looms
through the door to the west.

plates, and eating utensils.  The smell of freshly-prepared food comes from
the western end of the kitchen, where you can see a chef preparing food in a
rather frenzied manner.  To the east is the door leading out of the kitchen.

Most of them are on duty at any given moment, but a few are sleeping in the
bunk-beds provided for them.  A rather sparse display of art, presumably
painted by the children of these soldiers, are tacked to the walls.  To the
west, you see what seems to be a practice room.

enjoy the day without leaving the premises.  Plants are artfully placed and
upkept.  To the west, a path leads down the courtyard's length.  To the
east, a door leads back into the grand hall.

where all meals for the soliders and leaders of Skyflash are prepared;
there's a great many pots and pans strewn about, as well as a great many
food-items for them to be cooked in.  A chef and a few work-hands run to and
fro franticly preparing food; you assume there's a meal coming up.

about; they look rather dusty.  Seems they aren't used very often.  The
floor is padded to guard against hard falls, as are the walls.  To the east,
you see the sleeping quarters.

that would fall upon you from the sky.  In the tree's branches, you can here
a lone bird calling out; the feeling of serenity you felt earlier in the
gardens comes over you again.

be a small intersection of sorts; a path leads off both to the north and the
south, towards two small structures.  The northern seems to be a small
chapal; the southern looks more like a temple to a war god, with statues of
grand epic soldiers standing guard.  The path continues east and west
through the courtyard.

a small moat that needs to be crossed to gain access to the small gazebo to
the west.  The creek's clear waters are inhabited by many golden and orange
fish, who swim merrily to and fro, snacking on any insects or treats that
land on the creek's surface.  The path continues east and west.

The Crusader's Altar~
Here, in this small stone building, you find the altar to the mystical
crusaders that Skyflash used to be known for; they were famous for hunting
down evil whereever it may be.  There used to be an expression parents told
their children, along the lines of "knock it off, or the crusaders will
descend on you!"  The tradition has all but died in the past century or so,
and there hasn't been a hero to wear the Lode Relics for a long time.  This
seems to be the last refuge for them.

The Banzai House~
You are standing inside a gazebo on a small moat-enclosed island.  Here,
the lord of Skyflash seems to have made a banzai-house into his throne room;
it's probably more relaxing than being cramped in the palace all the time. 
A few banzai trees sit about, perfectly trimmed and shaped to accent their
natural structure.  To the east, a bridge leads off the small island, and
back towards the palace.

Behind the Painting~

What a bizarre thing to have for a door!  Basicly just a small ledge, this
room has a lone spiral staircase descending towards who-knows-what.  The
walls and floor are crude stone, and have absolutely no decoration anywhere.
Everything seems very dusty.  The exit through the painting is to the east.

slippery from the damp and dusty environment.  You should proceed carefully.

stairway completely from the far basement all the way to the second floor of
the palace; very curious.  It continues up and down.

from your disturbance when you descended.  To the east, a small, cramped
hallway leads off towards what looks like a door.  It's very dark and dreary
down here; almost like a cave.  You wonder why this cellar exists, since
there are no signs of anything ever being stored down here.

you could bash your way through it.  The lock looks very complex, and you
doubt you could pick it.  Sadly, you even notice some magical runes above
the door, so you begin to doubt you could magically pass through it.  It
looks like you'll be needing the key.

Crusaders of Lode.  In the center of the room, you see a solid jade chest;
this must be where the relics are kept!  But where is the key?
