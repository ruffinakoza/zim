page2~
The change of nature does not cause the change of court nor does the 
change of court cause the change in nature.  With the fae such things as 
cause are irrelevent, they simply are.  It is one of the things that make 
the fae so able to facinate mortals. 
~
E
page1~
The Seelie and Unseelie houses are the cornerstone of the fae nature.  
The Seelie is all that is chivalrous, good, fair, beautiful, light and 
graceful while the Unseelie is the counterpart of each of these 
qualities.  Just as the fae court switches alliances with each season so 
do individual fae.  While being immortal in nature, the fae are not 
unchanging.  The fae switch from one court to another at times within 
their existence.  The change is one of internal alliance and a once 
honest and loving Seelie fae can become a dishonest and distrusting one 
by changing courts.

The Fool seems to also ignore the house differences.  He seems to owe no 
particular alliegence to either court and seems to retain full use of his 
seemingly addled faculties throughout the year despite the seasonal 
variences that so affect his kind.
~
E
page1~
Puck is perhaps the single most powerful of all the fae.  Even Gwyn ap 
Nudd and Oberon pay this wanderer heed.  While usually he is nothing more 
than a trickster it seems that he is the only fae that has not gone a 
change of roles since the last cycle of fae existence. Why the Fool is 
exempt from these yearly changes is a mystery that only he may know and 
as is his nature he isn't telling.

you saw from the bottom must have just been something created by a 
combination of the light, the mist and your imagination because there is 
not castle here.  There is however a small standing stone with some worn 
engravings on it.  The only exit is down.

The Flower Meadow~
You are standing in a meadow full of tall grasses and an amazing
array of flowers.  The miasma of scents makes you slightly dizzy and the
swirl of colors as the flowers sway in the breeze doesn't help you
concentrate. Off to the west you see a hill with a glorious castle on top.

cavern might actually be a nice place to live.  There is what looks to be 
a bedroom to the north and some kind of hall to the east.

Woven tapestries of immortal battles lie rotting in the cases beside

interlocking spiral beadwork.  The treasured creations of some of the 
realm's finest craftsmen lay in these cases just beyond your grasp.  To 
the north is a bedroom and to the south you hear sounds of metalworking.

A tapestry on the east wall depicts two young figures, one boy and one 
girl.  For a moment you long for the lost innocence of that youth and you 
yearn to enter the tapestry, but then you pull yourself away from it's 
strange lure.  The hall continues north and south.

This hall is all green leaves and grass of a summer day.  Golden 
raidience shines down from the open roof above and birds chirp.  From 
somewhere you hear a brook babbling.  The eastern wall is dominated by a 
tapestry that shows two lovers in the prime of their life, and passions, 
in a summer field.  You sense that if you entered the now shimmering 
tapestry you too would be forever young and beautiful, unchanging and 
untouchable.  The tapestry dims and you hear laughter in the distance.  
The hall continues to the north and south.

The smell of fallen leaves and aproaching rain drifts sweetly through

orange, yellows, browns and pale green.  Soft rain drizzles in from the 
clouded grey sky above this chamber. There is a soft quiet sense to this room,
and when you look at the tapestry on the west wall depicting a middle 
aged couple resting quietly in each others arms you long for quiet 
companionship and find yourself reaching toward the tapestry.  You are 
shaken out of the trance by a raven's croak and you stand for a moment 
confused.  The hall continues to the north and south.

This hall is carpeted in deep, light snow that seems to be falling 
in from the ceiling.  Small ice statues can be seen in the distance and 
the treelike branches above are covered to near breaking with ice.  A cold 
wind blows with a shrill sound through the hall.  Totaly unmoved by the 
wind is a bright white tapestry on the west wall that shows an old couple 
whose faces show infinite wisdom and complacency.  You are entranced by 
the wisdom that the old couple wears like a mantle and you suddenly 
desire to seek it out by joining them in the tapestry. Then you hear a 
high pitched cackling and you shiver with the cold.  The Hall continues 
to the north and south.

The Base of the Eastern Tower~
This guard tower seems unussually well ordered.  These are clearly 
not ordinary soldiers.  The walls of the tower are bright and sparkiling 
golden.  To the west is a hallway leading to the main chambers of the 
castle and there is a staircase going up the tower.

This room is sparse except for a small table and the three racks of 
weapons that line the walls.  The weapons seem well cared for and in good 
condition.  Unfortunately they are also locked into the racks so you 
cannot get one for yourself.  A staircase leads downward and up to the 
top of the tower.

Inside the Western Guard Tower~
This room is used as a store place for the weapons of the guard.  It 
looks as if the guardsmen don't much care about the state of their 
weapons because the weapons racks are empty of all but a few broken 
shafts, handles and shards of blades.  The staircase leads back down or 
up to the top of the tower.

In the shadow of the hill where the castle lies is a small glade.
Many woodland creatures, small and large are gathered around a little boy
playing a pipe.  The music captures you for a moment and then the boy
stops playing.
The boy says 'I will play a tune for you for the right price. What would
you hear?'
