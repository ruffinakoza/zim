look at you, making the hairs on the back of your neck rise.

baobhan sith young woman maiden~
a Baobhan Sith~
A beautiful young maiden walks amongst the mist, singing softly.
~
Her hair is long and fair, her skin almost as white as snow, and her lips
the colour of crushed berries.  She gazes at you with big, watery blue eyes,
shining brightly though there is barely any light except the strange glow
that comes from the mist.  She wears a long white gown, with a white veil
that flows down to her feet, trailing across the ground.  The song she sings
is one of incredible beauty, though the words cannot be understood, always
just out of hearing.

A strange figure slowly turns towards you, and suddenly becomes a mirror image of yourself!
~
The form before you is a perfect imitation of yourself, from every strand
of hair to the wrinkles in your clothes and the dents in your armor.  The
eyes are lifeless, staring, but with a strange hunger deep in their depths. 
Your skin crawls as it steps towards you, becoming more lifelike by the
second, just waiting to destroy you and take over your existence.

a bendith y mamau~
An ugly, bent creature is here, playing a tune on its flute.
~
A bent, ugly creature is here, looking like a horrible cross between a
goblin and a faerie.  Nasty lumps of flesh rise out of its back, where wings
should be, twitching feebly whenever the creature moves.  Its skin is a
sickly gray-green, hanging loosely around its face and shoulders.  Its eyes
are like small, red beads, blinking rapidly as it watches you.  In its hands
it holds a simple wooden flute, clutching it tightly, as if it is precious.

Dressed in a pale gown that shimmers as though it was made of water,
there is something eerie about the woman, quite aside from the fact that she
is suspended in the air, her feet inches from the lake's surface.  Her face
would be beautiful but for the sadness that seems to be permanently upon it.
Her lips move as if to call out, but no sound emerges.

occasionally by deep wracking sobs.

a banshee~
A woman washes bloodied clothes in the stream, the water red around her.
~
Though she looks like a maiden from afar, a closer look reveals the
terrible truth.  Her hair is white and tangled, its long strands floating in
the water beside her.  Her mouth is huge, filled with black teeth and
letting out terrible bone-chilling shrieks that send a jolt of fear into
your very core.  The clothes she washes look familiar, but they are so
bloodied it is difficult to tell where they are from.  She washes them
carefully, letting a seemingly endless supply of blood by carried off by the
current, turning the river red around her.

watches you intrude upon her home, but even that does nothing to lessen her

rests on the throne, watching over her subjects.  Her hair is brown, falling
to her shoulders, and her eyes are so green that they're visible even from
the other end of the room.  She holds herself with an air of dignity, and
shows no fear as she watches you enter her throne room.

The Remains of a Trail~
The forest here is almost impossibly dense, making progress slow and
dangerous due to the roots and rocks hidden under the heavy foliage, waiting
to bring the unwary traveler to their knees.  Several bushes seem to have
been recently cut through, as if someone was trying to make their way
further into the forest by slashing at anything in their path.  Though much
of this makeshift trail is overgrown, it offers the quickest way through the
thick trees.

The Entrance to a Mist Shrouded Forest~
Thick trees rise up on every side, growing so closely together that it is
difficult to move through them.  They rise hundreds of feet high, their
branches spreading out at the top and interlocking with each other, blocking
almost all the light that seeks to filter through, leaving the floor of the
forest shrouded in darkness.  A light mist is visible in the distance,
weaving slowly among the trees, making it difficult to see very far beyond.

Ancient trees grow all around, many with trunks that are several feet
wide, their thick, deep roots plunging deep into the earth in search of
fresh water brough by recent rains.  A light mist can be seen weaving
through the trees to the east, making it difficult to make out anything
beyond it.  The forest is dark here, the leaves of the trees keeping out
almost any trace of light, though a stray strand does manage to reach the
forest floor here and there.

axe.  High above, thick spreading branches block out almost all the light
trying to shine through, leaving the forest floor in darkness.  A light mist
lies suspended over the forest floor to the east, slowing reaching out with
wispy tendrils that quickly dissisipate.

The air is cool and filled with the scents of the forest.  There is a
strange hushed feeling in the air.  Birds call out to each other, and every
once in a while there is a rustle in the bushes that announces the presence
of a small animal, but it seems as though everything is subdued, almost as
if there is a storm coming.

An immense, ancient tree grows here, its trunk almost twenty feet across.
It rises hundreds of feet high, towering over the other trees in the forest.
Green moss grows along its length, and a series of mushrooms seem to be
prospering on its south side.  The mist appears to stop just before it, as
if some force from the tree repels it.

Among the Mist-Shrouded Trees~
A light mist covers the forest floor, hiding the roots and bushes that
lie beneath.  The air is cool here, and the mist leaves drops of moisture on
whatever it touches.  Bushes rustle and leaves fall from the trees as small
animals rush to escape their predators, which are staying well-hidden if
they're out there.  Birds call out to each other softly, singing sweet
melodies, but even their calls can do little to dispel the hushed atmosphere
of the forest, as though the forest itself is slumbering, waiting to be
awakened.

Among the Mist-Shrouded Trees~
The trees grow thickly here, so close together that it's a wonder they've
all managed to grow so tall, with most reaching heights of hundreds of feet.
A light mist covers the entire forest floor, hiding the roots, plants and
rocks that lie beneath it.  To the east, the forest seems to darken, though
it is impossible to see very far beyond the trees.

Among the Mist-Shrouded Trees~
The ancient trees of the forest rise hundreds of feet in the air, their
branches weaving closely together to block out most of the light that seeks
to break through from the sky above.  Several strands of light manage to
reach the forest floor, cutting through the mist to illuminate the bushes
and flowers beneath.  To the south and east, the mist seems to grow heavier,
though it is difficult to see beyond all the thick trees.

Within the Dark Forest~
The forest here is dark, the tree branches above interlocked so tightly
that not even a single strand of light can break through.  The forest is
cold here, enough to cause your breath to freeze in the air before you.  A
heavy mist covers everything, glowing with its own faint light, and making
it impossible to see anything that isn't directly ahead of you.  Bushes
rustle all around you, and every now and then a twig breaks, but whatever is
causing the noise is always just out of sight.

Within the Dark Forest~
The forest is shrouded in total darkness, the only light coming from the
heavy mist that seems to have a faint glow.  The air is cold here, made
worse by the moisture that the mist leaves on whatever it touches.  Animals
call out from beyond the mist, which somehow transforms their cries into
demonic shrieks, sometimes from so close that you can almost feel them
breathing down your neck, but always out of sight.

Within the Dark Forest~
The mist here swirls wildly, moving forward quickly, even though there
isn't even a hint of wind this deep in the forest.  The forest is shrouded
in complete darkness, the trees above blocking out any light except the
faint glow that seems to be coming from the mist.  The air is cold, and the
moisture left by the mist as it touches you makes it feel even colder.  As
you progress through the trees, the moisture left by the mist makes it
harder and harder to maintain a steady grip on your weapon.  A quick look
down reveals that the moisture isn't water but really blood, running down
your hands and clothing in rivulets, left by the terrible mist.

A Clearing in the Forest~
The forest breaks into a small clearing here, with nothing growing inside
but grass, a large portion of which appears to have been scorched in a
recent fire.  At the very center of the clearing, the burnt ground forms a
perfect circle, exactly four feet in diameter and covered with dark symbols.
The forest is quiet here, almost as if every creature is holding its breath,
fearful of what might happen next.

A Shallow Stream~
The stream is only about fifteen feet across, but the water moves forward
with a force that could knock a man over.  It flows towards the north, its
icy water babbling over large stones scattered throughout, and threatening
to overflow over the banks in some places.  Wildflowers grow along the sides
of the streams, their blue petals adding a sweet beauty to the scene.

Faint light manages to weave through the trees above, with several

hint of weeping, though it is difficult to make out from here.

Tall trees grow all around, their branches interlocking tightly above,

patterns that pierce through the mist to illuminate the forest floor.  The
mist here is light, making it possible to get a clear view of the
surroundings.  Birds call out to each other, and small animals rush through
the bushes, seeking places of safety.  An eerie but immensely beautiful song
seems to be coming from deep in the forest, though it is difficult to
pinpoint the direction of its source.

surface.

heard above the babbling of the water.  Birds sing to each other, small
animals rush about, and off in the distance, a wolf howls, soon answered by
his brothers and sisters hidden among the trees.

The water foams white as it smashes around several large boulders lying on
the stream bed.

audible above the shrieks and cries of creatures always just out of sight.

The water splashes forward, flowing around large boulders lying along the

white foam, and makes it a challenge to wade across.  The trees of the
forest grow almost to the river's banks, leaving few good places to land.

Within the Mist-Shrouded Forest~
Faint light manages to weave through the trees above, with several
strands managing to break through the leaves and pierce through the light
mist, illuminating sections of the forest floor.  The air here is warmer,
though still cool whenever a patch of mist is encountered.  The sounds of
flowing water can be heard from almost every direction, along with a faint
hint of weeping, though it is difficult to make out from here.

Within the Mist-Shrouded Forest~
Tall trees grow all around, their branches interlocking tightly above,
preventing almost all the sky's light from entering the forest, though
several strands of light break through here and there, creating dancing
patterns that pierce through the mist to illuminate the forest floor.  The
mist here is light, making it possible to get a clear view of the
surroundings.  Birds call out to each other, and small animals rush through
the bushes, seeking places of safety.  An eerie but immensely beautiful song
seems to be coming from deep in the forest, though it is difficult to
pinpoint the direction of its source.

Within the Dark Forest~
The forest here is shrouded in darkness, a heavy mist covering
everything, from the forest floor below, to the tree tops above, making it
difficult to maintain a good sense of direction.  The sounds of flowing
water can be heard from nearby, strangely distorted by the mist, and barely
audible above the shrieks and cries of creatures always just out of sight.

A Shallow Stream~
The stream narrows drastically, its banks so close together that it is
almost possible to leap from one side to another in a single bound.  It
seems to be quite deep in several places, and it is impossible to see what
lies in its dark depths.  Beautiful flowers grow along the eastern bank,
thriving from the sunlight and the water.

The shore here is covered with pebbles and brown sand, along with weeds
left behind by the waves of the lake.  The trees of the forest grow almost
up to the water itself, stopping only a few feet away.  The sky above is
clearly visible, no longer hidden by the trees and mist of the forest, and
able to illuminate the lake below.  Birds circle overhead, calling out to
each other, and diving down periodically to try and catch a fish spotted
from above.  Large rocks surround the shore, poking out above the water, and
giving the mistaken impression that the lake is shallow.

On the Lake~
Water ripples calmly along the surface of a vast lake, a soft and gentle
wind causing small waves to lap up against a shore of brown sand that is
only a few feet away from the trees of the surrounding forest.  The water is
clear and blue, spreading eastward as far as the eye can see.  The mist
weaves among the trees, but stays well clear of the lake itself.  Birds fly
overhead, every now and then plunging down from the sky towards the water,
only to come back out with a struggling fish grasped firmly in their beaks. 
Several large boulders can be seen in the lake, waves lapping up against
them.

On the Lake~
The water is clear and blue across the lake, reflecting any light cast
upon it.  Directly below, however, is inky blackness, hinting at the lake's
vast hidden depths.  The water is calm, moving forward in soft waves
propelled by a gentle wind coming from the east.  Birds can be seen circling
overhead in the distance, though none travel this far into the lake.  Fish
can be seen swimming just under the surface, moving in thick schools and
paying little attention to your presence.

A Shallow Stream~
The stream takes a turn here, the current weaker than to the south, but
still strong enough to send water crashing into the northern bank, as well
as any unwary people traveling by boat.  A soft wind rustles the tree
branches above the stream, causing leaves to detach and fall slowly to the
stream's water, to be carried away and submerged by the current.

A Shallow Stream~
The trees grow right up to the banks here, their leaves allowing the
sunlight to filter through and dance on the surface of the stream water. 
Every now and then fish are seen jumping out of the water and landing back
in with a splash, as they swim fast against the current.  To the west, the
stream seems to widen, and a large lake is visible off in the distance.

A Shallow Stream~
The stream that flows in from the east joins with the lake here, lending
a steady supply of water.  Tall grasses grow in the water, making navigation
between the lake and the stream slow.  A soft current pushes westward, where
the vast lake expands and spreads outward, its calm waters clear and blue,
reflecting the light from the sky.

A Clearing in the Forest~
A small clearing lies at the center of the forest, perhaps thirty feet
across.  Nothing grows in the clearing but grass, and the middle of the
clearing appears to have been recently ravaged by fire, with the smell of
smoke still heavy in the air.  The burned area seems to form a perfect
circle, four feet in diameter, the inside of which is covered in
unrecognizable symbols.

The Grave Mounds~
The forest seems to be completely silent here, as if every creature is in
mourning, or afraid to come any closer than absolutely necessary to several
large grave mounds located at the center of this clearing.  Even the forest
itself seems reluctant to approach, with at least a twenty foot distance to
the nearest tree, and a large patch of dirt around the mounds where not even
a single weed grows.  Stone tablets have been placed at the head of each
mound, identifying the dead.

The Grave Mounds~
The forest seems to be completely silent here, as if every creature is in
mourning, or afraid to come any closer than absolutely necessary to several
large grave mounds located at the center of this clearing.  Even the forest
itself seems reluctant to approach, with at least a twenty foot distance to
the nearest tree, and a large patch of dirt around the mounds where not even
a single weed grows.  Stone tablets have been placed at the head of each
mound, identifying the dead.

Within the Mist Shrouded Forest~
A light mist surrounds the trees, covering the forest floor in a
blue-gray shroud.  The air is cool here, though not unpleasant, even with
the cold drops of water left behind on everything the mist touches.  Tall
trees rise all around, blocking out most light seeking to break through the
leaves above, though several strands manage to break through and illuminate
isolated sections beneath the trees.

The Faerie Ring~
The trees here appear to be immensely ancient, rising hundreds of feet in
the air, their trunks wide enough to fit a large house inside.  The grass
and vegetation surrounding them seem to be vividly green and vibrant, as if
disease, decay and death have never touched this section of the forest. 
Light filters down from above, creating dancing patterns that land on
beautiful flowered bushes and soft, dew-covered grass.

The Faerie Ring~
Beautiful flowers of every shape and shade of colour imaginable grow
beneath the trees, filling the air with their sweet scents.  Every plant
growing here, from the large, ancient trees, to each individual blade of
grass, all seem to be filled with life, in perfect health and untouched by
any disease or sickness.  Small animals dart through the grass, some passing
right by you, completely disinterested in your presence.  Birds call out to
each other, filling the forest with their song.  A small circle of rocks
surrounds a hole in the earth, whose depths are hidden from sight.

The Faerie Ring~
Countless flowers grow beneath the trees, their sweet scents strong in
the air, filling the surroundings with a lovely smell that is almost
unearthly.  Trees grow tall all around, rising to great heights and giving
this section of the forest an almost timeless feel, as if there hasn't been
a single change to this place since the creation of the world.

A Clearing in the Forest~
The trees suddenly give way to a small clearing, about thirty feet across
in all directions.  Nothing but grass grows along its entire length, except
for the very center, which seems to have been scorched in a recent fire.  A
perfect circle about four feet in diameter lies at the center of the burned
ground, strange symbols drawn into the dust all across its interior.  The
forest is unnaturally quiet here, and there is a discomforting feel to the
entire clearing.

At the Bottom of the Hole~
Shafts of light pour down from the hole above, illuminating the tunnel
just below.  Several passageways seem to have been burrowed deep into the
earth, the walls close together and the ceiling barely seven feet above the
floor.  The smell of fresh earth is strong here, and the walls are covered
with moisture.  The air is surprisingly cool and fresh, and the walls and
ceiling seem to be quite sturdy despite the lack of any support.  The
passageway continues to the east, while to the north a small door is set
into the wall.

This small room contains furniture that looks to have been taken from a

nothing on it at the moment.  Several rickity wooden chairs have been placed
next to it, though they don't look sturdy enough to sit on safely.  A small
round door is set into the southern wall, leading out into the passageway.

Flowers seem to have been planted in the walls, and through some magical means 
coaxed into blooming as if they were out in a clear meadow. The scents of their 
blossoms fill the air, mixing with the earthy scent of the walls to create a 
lovely effect, like walking through a beautiful garden. Lanterns hang from the 
ceiling at regular intervals, providing a soft light. A small door is set into 
the southern wall, and the passageway continues to the east and west.

The Sleeping Area~
This room is relatively large, compared to the hallway.  The ceiling is
still quite low, but the room is dug in a circular shape at least thirty
feet across in diameter.  Leaves seem to have been collected from the forest
outside and arranged into leaf beds, some barely more than small piles,
others large enough for a human to comfortably lie in.  The room is
perfectly quiet, with no sounds escaping through the door set into the wall
to the north.

only small blades of grass growing from their sides.  Lanterns hang from the
ceiling, lit by bright lights of magical energy that shine bright enough to
make it seem like daylight, though when looked at directly they appear to be
as weak as candle flames.  A door is set into the southern wall, sized just
large enough for a human to cross comfortably through.

means.  The air here is still cool and refreshing, despite the fact that it
is underground, with no access to the surface in sight.  To the east there
is a large room, though it is difficult to make out any details from this
position.  To the north is a round door, set into the wall.

The chamber here is bigger by far than anything else found in the
tunnels.  Small steps lead down to the floor of the chamber, which is
circular in shape.  The ceiling rises over twelve feet in height, and the
chamber itself appears to be about twenty feet across.  A large throne is at
the center of the floor, carved out of stone and polished smooth.  Faeries
stand by the walls all around the room, watching you closely and whispering
to each other.

A Storage Room~
The room here is tiny, with barely room enough for more than a few people
to stand.  It seems to be used as a storage room, with a large shelf taking
up most of the space not occupied by burlap sacks.  Most of the items placed
on the shelf seem to be of little interest; they consist mostly of acorns,
flower seeds, and moss collected from the forest.  The door to the south is

Gold coins have been scattered across the room, as well as
several glittering jewels.  All sorts of treasures seem to have been
gathered, though most don't seem any more valuable than a silver coin.  It
seems as though the faeries have collected anything that caught there
attention and dumped it all in this room in random piles.  Emeralds are
placed next to half-broken clay bowls, and silk scarves are lying next to
stones that seem to have been gathered from a river bed.  Nothing seems to
be organized in any recognizable fashion, and it appears as though the
faeries find strangely shaped rocks from the forest to be as valuable a
treasure as the most precious jewels.

A Shelter in the Forest~
A small shelter has been created using the space between a large boulder
and a tree.  The shelter seems to be created of fallen branches, their size
and length varying greatly, hardly good materials for a stable structure. 
It does appear quite strong, however, and seems to have survived the
elements quite well.  The remains of a small fire are visible near the
shelter, though it is barely visible.  It appears as though this place is
used to offer a place to rest for those wishing to explore the beauties of
the forest.

Over and over you spin her, until your head grows dizzy and you feel you're about to fall. It's hard to think clearly, but you manage to think to yourself as the maiden's arms tighten around you and you feel a sharp pain in your neck that maybe you shouldn't be dancing with strange women in the middle of a dark forest.
mob echoaround $n As $n spins the maiden around, he seems to be lost in her eyes, and before anything can be done to stop her, she moves in close to him, holding him tightly, and biting deeply into his neck, draining him of his life's blood.
