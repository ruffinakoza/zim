A tall skeletal figure stands before you, cackling insanely.

Gulshtukh~
Gulshtukh, Baron of Chaos, guards the entrance to the Realms.
~
A stocky grey-skinned dwarf stands here clad in a black, shiny suit of
full platemail.  The silk cape flapping about his shoulders is covered with
strange and horrible symbols, the markings a distinction of his rank as a
dark baron of the Chaos realms.  Tread lightly around this powerful one, for
he is unpredictable, and may take your life on a whim.

the old {Mp{Rr{BA{Mn{Rk{Bs{MT{Re{BR{x~
The {cg{Chost{x of an old {Mp{Rr{BA{Mn{Rk{Bs{MT{Re{BR{x is here trying to teach you a new trick.
~
Back when {Mc{RH{Ba{Mo{RS{x organized, this old gnome went around tricking the tricksers
just to keep them honest.  The greatest prankster of the realm in his time,
his name was feared and known to insite belly laughs at even its whisper.
All that came to an end, when the Arch-Mage Eb'owa found his familiar
tarred and feathered.  The Arch-Mage used all his power to slay this
prankster and purge his name from the realm.  Not even the ghost knows
it.  But instead of retiring to the underworld he's come back as a 
poltergeist to haunt these halls and teach new members his old tricks.
If you have any questions, ask him to {Gtell you about{x his chops.

The Entrance to a Cavern~
The water-filled tunnel ends abruptly and widens into a large cave to the
east.  The rocky floor of the cavern is damp and slick with moss, and
footing treacherous.  A shadow rises up from the floor and approaches you at
a rapid pace.  Chuckling, you dismiss it as your imagination.

  MWUAHAHAHA!!
 
A pair of glowing red eyes appear out of the darkness.  This is no imagination!

At the Back of the Cavern~
You are standing at the back of a large, unlit cavern.  Walking to the
edge to peer down, your foot kicks a small rock and sends it spinning into
space.  You hear it bounce off the walls of the chasm several times, and it
falls for what seems like an eternity before clattering noisily onto the
ground below.  To the left wall of the cavern you think you make out a large
window...

Grateful for your ability to fly, you are able to ascend safely down the
rocky chasm.  A cold breeze gusts upwards from below, blowing dirty and
spiderwebs off the rocky walls into your face and mouth.  You claw at the
grit in your eyes, and succeed in banging your head against a rocky outcrop.
You absentmindedly wonder what kind of mind it takes to create a sanctuary
of refuge in such a ridiculous place as this.

nearly one hundred and fifty men across All around the room you see

magical and some are uncut and un polished.  You can see armor from many
lands along with weapons beside the armor, inside the armor you can see the
skeletons of those that used it previously.  In the center of the room on
top of the largest pile of treasure you can barely make out an enormous
shadowy form.  As you slowly approach the large pile of treasure, the
shadowy figure lifts its head and roars so loud that large rocks rain down
upon your nearly smashing you to death.  You notice the shadowy figure is
