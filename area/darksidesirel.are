mysterious wanderer man~
The Mysterious Wanderer~
A man stands here with a crooked smile, gazing at you contemptuously.
~
Clad in dark clothing in a fashion you've never seen before, this man is
obviously not from the area.  His features are pleasant enough, save for a
long dark scar that runs down his forehead to end just above his left ear. 
He wears a crooked grin as he looks you over, and you cannot help but feel
that there is a deep contempt in his gaze.

Her face is covered in blood, though it doesn't appear to be her own. 
She smiles at you, showing her teeth, which appear to be sharpened to fine
points, bits of flesh and blood dyeing them red.  Her yellow curls are
tangled and covered with filth, and her once white dress is ripped in
various places and stained by blood.  She holds a small doll in her hands,
and appears to stop and talk to it every few moments.

From the looks of it, it wasn't the fall itself that killed this being,

The Entrance to the Ruined Inn~
A large gaping hole stands where the door should be, the wood around it
broken and splintered as if something just burst through.  The common room
is a complete mess, the tables and chairs destroyed and a strong scent of
charred wood coming from the north.  Through the doorway to the south lies
the ruins of the village, many of the houses no longer standing or looking
as if they are ready to collapse.  Terrible screams and cries pierce the
eerie stillness, seeming to come from all directions.

The Ruined Inn~
The stone fireplace seems to be the only part of this room that has
escaped destruction.  The walls are black and ash covers the floor. 
Whatever chairs and tables that have survived the fire lie in broken heaps,
completely ruined.  The air is thick with the smell of burned flesh, and a
large stain of blood covers the floor and wall by the fireplace, though it
doesn't appear to be fresh.

The large window on the southern wall has been boarded up tightly, though
a small crack remains where you can see the land beyond the inn.  It appears
to be dreary and desolate, with smoke rising from several of the ruined
houses, and a terrible stench coming from the stream nearby.  The common
room is completely destroyed, not a single chair or table left standing,
everything lying in ruin.

Beneath the Stairs~
There is little room to move inside this tight space.  It appears to have
once been used as a storage closet, but the small door to the east is shut
tight and cannot seem to be opened.  It would seem that the only way out is
back the way you came, by climbing back up through the hole in the stairs. 
A skeleton by your feet probably belongs to someone who wasn't quite as

Before the Ruins of the Inn~
The inn rises up before you, leaning crookedly towards the stream as if
it is ready to fall in.  From this vantage point it is evident that all the
windows have been boarded up, as if to try and keep out any sight of the
horrors assaulting the village.  A large stain of blood lies directly before
the door, several days old.  A simple wooden sign annoucing the inn's name
swings in the breeze, its creaking ominous amidst the deathly silence of the
village.

a bloated body floats past beneath the bridge, along with other things

nothing more than white bone with patches of flesh.  The air is stiflingly

From what can be seen here, corpses litter the streets, the bodies of

search of anything that remains alive.  Some of them appear to have noticed

across them are the walking corpses of the dead, ready to lunge at you as
soon as you enter their sight.  The air here is terribly hot, made worse by
the horrible stench of death that seems to come from all around.  Much of
the village lies in ruins, the houses collapsed or burned to ashes, though a
few remain intact, if barely so.  The road continues south through the

corpses.  A small side path branches off to the west.

spots at various points.  Even the great trunks show signs of being ravaged

and appear to be more or less intact.  To the north lies a modest home, its
front door torn completely off its hinges and discarded to the side.  To the
west, the door to another modest home has been completely boarded up, and it
seems as though it will be impossible to enter that way, though there is a
window by the side of the house that might be a way in.

that any struggle occured here.  The only thing that hints of trouble is the
way in which the door has been barricaded to prevent anything from breaking
in.  A thin layer of dust covers everything, including a corpse that is
lying atop the bed.  The corpse is that of a woman, and from the looks of
it, she hasn't been dead very long.  She holds a piece of parchment grasped

I realize that you wish to gain your father's blessing before we wed,
but there will be plenty of time for that after. Our families will

I wish to marry you, Melanda. Tonight. I know of a priest in Caerlon
who would be willing to perform the ceremony. We could go there under

A Black Stream~
The stream here gradually becomes more shallow, making passage by boat
somewhat treacherous.  Many of the corpses floating by have gathered here,
limbs and bodies stuck at a narrow point in the stream, filling the air with
the scent of death and decay.  To the south stands a small, forested island,
its tall trees growing close together but broken by a small path that leads
into the depths of the forest.

The trees grow thickly on the island, making it difficult to progress

grow along the edge of the path, and the trees here appear to be healthy,
keeping the air fresh and cool.  The stream can still be seen through the
trees to the north, but looking towards the south, its easy to forget the
horrors of the village.

Before a Great Temple~
A great temple rises up through the trees, its white marble walls
glistening brightly even in the absense of the sun's light.  Statues of
noble looking men and women stand tall by the path that leads towards the
doors of the temple, keeping a silent watch.  Several pale steps lead up to
the temple doors, one of which is slightly ajar.  There is a deep sense of
peace here, and you can almost forget the terrible fate of the nearby
village.

The Temple of Talath~
The inside of the temple is simple in its splendour.  The floor is of
highly polished marble, shining brightly and reflecting the light from the
torches and candles by the walls.  A small but beautiful altar stands at the
very center of the temple, directly beneath a domed ceiling decorated with
beautiful paintings of a benevolent god.  Despite its beauty, the temple has
a strange feeling of emptiness to it, though it is clear that someone has
recently been here.

The wooden bridge casts a dark shadow over the water, not a single strand
of light making its way through the cracks.  The water is cold, and moves
sluggishly, though there appears to be something moving just beneath its

back down below.  A rotten, bloated corpse lies just under the bridge, face
fixed in horror.

The dark water rushes out from the mountain wall, pouring down into the
stream below.  The water gushing out appears to be fresher than that of the
stream, but does little to purify it, instead becoming corrupted itself as
soon as it hits the surface.  The stream doesn't seem very deep here, but
the water rushing down from above makes it unsafe to stay here for long.

Immediately upon entering the kitchen, a putrid smell assaults you.  A
decomposing corpse lies on the floor, flies buzzing around it, already half
eaten by maggots.  Blood covers part of the wall, with several bloody
handprints showing signs of a struggle.  The cabinets are still well-stocked
with food, though much of it has gone bad.  A bowl of fruit on the counter
is covered with tiny insects, busily devouring what is left.

Since the destruction of the orcish invasion force in the Month of 
Winter, ca. 566, the Order of Talath has thrived, the Knights 
spreading order throughout the land as more and more temples are built 
in villages and cities alike.
 
Reports that the man who led the orc invasion has been killed in 
the fighting have remained impossible to verify. Several accounts 
have been told of his survival, though if he remains alive, no sign 
has been seen of him in years, and there is no evidence that he is 
gathering more forces for a second assault.{x
