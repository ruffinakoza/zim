barnicle~
Barnicle~
Barnicle is scribbling on a scroll with a feathered quill.
~
This dull, bespectacled man does not seem like he would be much enthused
about everything.  With scrolls all around his tiny thin body, and his
fingers calloused from tons of copying and writing, it is amazing this old
fool is still alive.

A golden haired girl wearing a short tartan skirt carries a plate of drinks.
~
This blonde girl probably makes more money in tips than the owner of this
bar does from her selling the drinks.  It is a good ploy to use her though.

Canda~
Canda, the potion maker and gnome caretaker is stirring a cauldron's contents.
~
In stature, she is short and rather fat, but that's normal among her
people and for gnomes a rather attractive one.  While Canda's fingers look a
bit burnt and scarred, her physical appearance has not been altered by the
dangerous magics and chemicals she works with.  Which may or may not be a
good sign for her customers.

Rupert~
Rupert the robes maker and craftsman is arranging some boots on a shelf.
~
From behind a delicious mess of amber-red hair and sea-blue eyes, this
young chap strides toward you, on his arm an assortment of fine wizarding
robes.  His charming grin is what conjures most women into buying his goods,
though they really are fine goods.  Whenever a young woman strides in the
shop, her lover is sure to meander in after her, making sure she doesn't
leer at Rupert for too long.  He is, how you say, gorgeous in the eyes of
all the women of Cradlenook, and that could very well be the reason why his
shop is prospering so well.  He wears a pair of fine, forest green robes and
dull black boots on his feet.

A primary school teacher taps away at the blackboard with a piece of chalk.
~
Her fingers are covered in white chalk, probably from the lessons she
teaches all days.  Even her face seems a bit pasty white, perhaps she is
doing something she should not with the chalk?  While she may be sniffing
chalk, her senses remain acute to naughty children or angry parents.

The Cradlenook lunch lady stands behind an open window serving food.

Meet the large and rather angry looking lunch lady who scars the little
children of Cradlenook for life.  The food she serves is just as disgusting
looking as the lunch lady's pus-filled boils and her pimpled face.  Ahh, the

An angry parent is searching crazily for a Cradlenook teacher.

Get out of the way of this deranged mother.  One can only wonder why she
is so angry, perhaps her child's grades were lower than she wanted them to
be, or that the teacher is not doing well enough in teaching her child the
fundamentals.  Whatever the problem, it's none of your yours, and it would
be a good idea not to get involved.

During her lifetime, Aldina Sophry molded many minds at Cradlenook, and
inspired many of its youth to become educated statesmen and business owners.
While her teachings were limited to history, english, and art, many of her
students remember her kind voice and spirit.  The warmth she shared in life
continues to grace the graveyard she was buried in.

the ghost of Frederik May~
The ghost of Frederik May bobs aimlessly through the headstones.
~
The infamous Frederik May who terrorized this school while he was its
janitor.  While most parents no longer remember his sordid escapades with
the little girls in the bathroom stalls or with little boys in his janitor's
closet, Frederik's memory and his ghost live amongst the ghosts of many of
his former victims, each with their own sad tales about this ghastly
character.  Luckily for the children of Cradlenook today, Frederik May was
hunted down and executed by a mob of angry parents and some soldiers and now
his floating spirit remains trapped on this plane.

A child of Cradlenook is running havok amok through the boulevard.

Screaming happily at everyone who walks by, including you, she waves her
arms about in a wild flailing motion, throwing pebbles and stones at stray
cats and dogs, not knowing exactly what she's doing in her juvenile age. 
Her hair comes down to her chin and looks tousled from rough housing.  Upon
her feet are two cute, tiny pink sandals that make a tapping noise when she
scampers on by.

overalls that come up far above his small ankles; one strap hangs over his
chest, revealing a wife-beater tank top.

A beautiful swan is floating upon the basin.

Unlike how a playful duck would paddle and splash in the water, she
merely grazes the surface of the water with her beak, never fully submersing
herself in it.  She floats gracefully and serenely across the basin,
enjoying the quietness of the area.  She doesn't seem to take any notice of
your presence, perhaps she is trying to pretend you don't exist; this is,
after all, her territory.

It is obvious this middle aged man has a dire love for hunting.  A
camouflage overcoat consumes his bulky, muscular body, and beneath it a
bright orange t-shirt.  On his feet he wears two heavy leather boots which
have been cleaned to a tee as to not muck up the cabin.  An old pot-shaped
cap rests just over his rectangular-shaped face to block out any light as he
rests.  Cradled in his left arm is an eight-barrel gun; he always brings it
with him anywhere he goes.

Disgusting hacks and coughs emit from Francis' mouth nearly every other

wondering why you've stepped into his not-so-lovely home.  On his belly
rests a bottle of ale which he glugs on every now and then, never flinching
at its awful taste.  He wears a beat up and holey old white t-shirt, well,
now its sort of yellow and stained brown in spots.  Dark green pants save
you from seeing his heavily hairy legs, and a pair of black old boots saves
you the joy of inhaling the scent of his mold-smelling feet.

Wearing a fine black suit, he waves a graceful, slow arm at you to

his feet, which cannot be too comfortable after wearing them for 10 hours a

protrudes a bit beneath his black tux coat like a bowling ball, and his
cheeks appear bloated, as if he had been munching on something salty, but
really they are just chubby.

A middle aged man wearing silky blue pajamas and a dark blue nightcap is
curled up on the king size bed.  His name is Albus Frenwick, mayor of
Cradlenook.  Some like him, most don't, mainly because of where he spends
his money, and that is quite obvious taking in the mint upholstery of his
fine home.  A long, grey, curling mustache flickers on his lips as he snores
loudly in his sleep, and from time to time, grunts.

Alrich, the local butcher man stands here being all butcher man like.

Covered in blood and sweat, Alrich wipes his forehead and continues to
chop up thick slabs of meat, handing them off to his worker bees to wrap and
toss in the glass display out front.  His white working uniform is stained
in red and brown blood and tied around the middle with a tight white belt.

Jared, the skinny skinny skinny dude~
Jared stands here, shoveling fresh subs into his abyss of a mouth.
~
He's skinny.  REAL skinny.  Maybe it would be a good idea to lay off the
skinny subs.  His ribcage can be seen through his tight uniform and his
cheeks have sunken in like a skeleton.  His fingers appear old like a
grandma's fingers, crooked, skinny and bent out of shape.  He encourages you
to try the sub that changed his life.

Sailie~
Sailie, an established artist and writer, is climbing up the wall ladder.
~
Short, red spiky hair juts out from her head naturally as if she has just
rolled out of bed.  Around her neck she wears a paint pallet shaped pendant
with tiny specs of color representing paint.  She is the great great grand
daughter of Jaken Leidig, the well known artisan of many art pieces in
Cradlenook, including the mirror faced stone and marble statue.  Her eyes
radiate a love for painting and writing, they seem to always be washed in a
wild haze when she is thinking of a new project to begin.  Lr 1 Short, red

statue~
Whoever created this statue must have had a skewed vision of who the
Goddess Kira is, or perhaps was making a mockery of felines altogether.  A
wobbly bow about the size of the goddess' head itself has been plopped down
between two perky cat ears.  Two overly large teary eyes take up a great
portion of her face, giving the statue a somewhat kitten-ish appearance. 
From behind the statue a long slick tail hangs loosely from the body.  The
fur appears almost mop-like and wild, tousled and sprouting out in every
direction as if she had been rubbing up against something.  She appears
nothing more than a commoner feline in the artist's depiction.  Quite
possibly that is how the goddess really appears and the artist had no
intention of making a mockery, but it surely does not have the stereotypical
celestial appearance of a goddess.  Nevertheless, the talent put into the
statue is impeccable and flawless.

A smooth oak sign with careful bold etchings of the words {YWelcome to{x
{YCradlenook{x in it, the C on Cradlenook the most prominent and painted black,
has been placed in an arch over a pebbled trail; it beckons passerby
northward into the villa Cradlenook.  Running in a small rivulet below the
path from west to east is the river Songuia.  Its waters flow about
Cradlenook's borders, flooding in from the west, and gurgling back in a
stream near its inlet, making a giant circle around the villa.

Fluttering in with the winds dance leaves and blades of green grass from
the flourished nooks and crannies of the villa's forested areas.  Floating
along with them are the sounds of deep bellied laughter and the smells of
liquor and bread flour; the wind must be coming in from the east through the
trees.  Small wooden signs have been planted into the soil next to small
clusters of flowers, labeling each group with the species name and a small
description of each.

Groups of small pedaled flowers sprinkle either side of the way.  Thin
white bark trees have been planted to keep the area cool and well shaded;
the flowers border the roots of the trees and circle the trunks as if they
have been planted carefully to do just so.  Spirits street, home to the
Fox's Beard, extends off to the east.  Flour and liquor float through the
air, filling the nostrils of hungry passerby.

Widget Way - 200 W~
A thin pebbled path lined with shops full of goods for the students of
Cradlenook extends on to the east with Cranny Way just back to the west. 
Streams of smoke puff steadily out from chimneys in the brick faced shops,
and rise into the air and disappear above the treetops.  Hanging in each
doorway is a sign with the name of the shop one is about to enter, and the
goods they have in stock.

Barnicle's Books and Scrolls~
Very close in resemblance to a library, Barnicle's Books and Scrolls is
laden with long wooden shelves covered in alphabetized spell books.  Coiled
carefully and placed into vases are dozens of scrolls; each rests upon a
long wooden table on the back wall with a piece of brilliant white ribbon
tied about the midriff.  Lamps hang from hooks on the ceiling in every
corner of the shop as well as in the very center, keeping the shop well lit.
Quills with glitzy charms and beautiful white feathers are placed carefully
in tiny holsters upon the eastern wall.  Underneath is a single scroll upon
which one can test out its ink.  Barnicle makes his way through the isles of
shelves, peeking through the books for incoming customers.

Spirits Street - 190 W~
A bitter smell of high proof liquor rises into your nostrils; along with
it is a trace of flour scent and the smell of fresh milk.  Spirits Way runs
into the Fox's Beard not far to the west, where many social on goers of
Cradlenook like to mingle.  Small pubs and shacks line up down the way, each
filled with shelves of rum and different kinds of beer.  Those who are known
to not hold their alcohol well will be laughed at in places of such.

Spirits Street - 200 W~
The starchy smell of old pubs fills the air, mixed in it a rich smell of
bread flour coming from a cedar pub to the north.  The sound of mugs
clashing together with high pitched clinks come from the Fox's Beard nearby;
an occasional smash rings out as a glass mug shatters on the floors inside. 
Constant thuds from fists banging on tables make the earth outside feel as
if it were about to begin shaking; in the Fox's Beard, drinking contests are
almost always on the go.

The path ascends in a gradual uphill slant to the center of the village. 
The path slowly transforms from a sandy walk into a cobblestoned street. 
The further into the village, the more industrialized things will become. 
Deep green moss from beneath the stately trees encroaches on the
cobblestones in cracks and crannies.

{DC{Wradle{Yn{yook {DS{Wquare{x~
The small square of Cradlenook is encompassed on each corner with trees
and shrubberies; to the north an old graveyard bearing the dead of the
village can be found fenced with needle spires.  Off to the east and west
the Villa Promenade shoots off.  The open-air of the square skirts a small
granite fountain which is surrounded by benches.  The fountain shoots a
constant spray of crystal water ten feet into the air.  The cobblestone of
the square has grayed with time, and in between the cracks of the stone,
moss can be seen flourishing.

The Fox's Beard~
Prominent scents of ale, stew, and bread flour linger in the air in the
Fox's Beard.  The walls, floorboards, ceiling and bar frame are all
constructed from fine cedar, and have been polished to such a point they
almost appear to be wax.  Solid oak casks peek out from behind the bar where
they have been gathered in stock; a few of them have been placed atop the
bar, and merry folks rosy in the cheeks press the taps as they stumble on
by.  Natural light pours in from the several windows of the tavern,
revealing dust particles in the air.  Tables and benches have been placed
about the room to provide seating for social on goers.

A Comfortable Loft~
A red, brick chimney pokes through the fine cedar flooring along the
western wall and out through the angled wood ceiling.  A worn couch patched
together with a fool's motley of red and yellow scraps rests before the
chimney way.  A hinged door, bent upward on one corner from old age, is
built into the floor in the southeast corner of the room; smells from the
bar below waft in through it, enveloping the room in an aroma of liquor and
bread flour.  A simple oak table rests before the old couch.  Strewn upon it
are a variety of pints and mugs, once filled with spirits; each cup has been
drank completely dry.  Overhead in the northeast corner of the room is
another hatchback door leading to the roof; below it, a wooden ladder has
been nailed to the wall.

A Well Maintained Shingled Roof~
Thick clouds of steamy white smoke billow from the fireplace chimney and
rise into the sky.  A limited view of the city of Midgaard opens up beyond
the roof line, but the Fox's Beard is not built quite high enough to see
beyond city buildings and walls.  Just northwestward lies the Market Square,
its premise bustling away as it always is.  The roof tiles of the bar are
painted a dark shade of turquoise.  It is obvious the roof is often
maintained and washed clean of pigeon scrap, as it is easy to slip and fall
astray from its smooth tiles.

Widget Way - 190 W~
Small, smooth round pebbles have been tossed on the path, forming a layer
about three inches thick.  With each step a passerby takes, a grinding
crunch can be heard.  Warmth radiates from shops on either side of the way;
from inside one of them, brilliant explosions and flashes of light can be
seen.  Someone must be working on making potions for buyers.

Canda's Cauldrons and Concoctions~
A quaint little cabin, which appears to be half house half shop, glints
with shiny vials of swirling potions.  Up a small flight of stairs onto a
wooden plateau on the west corner of the room is Canda's simple bed and
dresser.  Below it a small wooden door is cracked open under the stairs
where an interesting gnome spends his time crafting baubles and trinkets.  A
stove rests at the north end of the room upon which a pan bubbles a blue
liquid.  Beside it a cauldron gurgles away, gigantic silvery bubbles popping
in the heat of a fire lit beneath it.  With all of the lit stoves, lanterns
and cauldrons, the shop is quite a steamy, sweaty place to be.  All the
windows in the cabin remain open, and a fan, crafted by the handy gnome
under the stairs, pushes a constant breeze through the room.

Widget Way - 180 W~
An abrupt end in the trail takes place where the pebbles of the path meet
the edge of a grassy knoll.  The sounds of explosions and conversation have
faded to the east; the prominent sounds apparent now are those of feet
stomping on up the knoll and fading over the top.  Weeds have grown thick
where the pebbles meet the grass; a row of dandelions has grown as if
someone had gone along and planted a line of seeds.  A dark wooden shop with
curtains drawn over the windows lies southward.

Rupert's Robes and More~
A dark wooded room lit only by two brass hooded lanterns, which hang from
hooks on the ceiling, opens up before you.  Upon the walls robes and wizard
hats are hung on display to show what is on sale.  The finest of the robes
and hats can be found safely protected behind cubicles of glass.  The most
prominent of robe colors is brown, but that is no surprise, as the entire
shop seems to be clan in dark forest colors.  On the back wall beneath a
display of forest green robes is a wooden shelf laden with a discord of
boots.  Some of the boots have wings etched into the leather tongue flaps,
others appear so heavy that it is a wonder how anyone could ever wear them
and walk properly and not stumble about.  The man who owns the shop spends
his time gathering around the world the proper materials to craft such top
mage wear.

Across a Grassy Knoll~
A clear, natural path in the knoll about two feet wide extends upward
where feet have pressed the grass into the ground, smashing it completely
flat.  A few ground holes surround the area, exposing a dark brown soil,
where burrowing animals have dug homes for themselves.  A cool breeze sweeps
over the knoll, tickling the grass blades and sending them into a dancing
frenzy.

Beside the path, full body imprints have been pressed into the grass from
tired climbers and playful children.  A single tree stump sanded to
perfection to be used as a makeshift chair is rooted in the ground to the
west of the foot pressed path.  A few hedgehog needles can be seen left on
the edge of the stump, be careful not to sit on them.

A Limited View of Widget Way~
The rooftops of the shops below can be seen from the top of the knoll. 
Barnicle's shop chimney sends smoke into the air and it nearly floats to
this knoll before it disperses and fades into nothing.  Canda's Cauldron
shop can be seen glowing from its windows in a brilliant green light, often
flashing white from a potion explosion, and returning to its normal state. 
Just north of here an old school house stands; it appears quite old, but
still in use.

Cradlenook School House of Spellcasting~
Just beyond the Widget Way outlook an old school house stands.  Its
floors have been polished and waxed in attempt to look a bit newer, as it is
decades old.  Only a few children of Cradlenook still attend, and two
teachers uphold it alone.  It consists of two rooms, one of which is a tiny
classroom, and the other a lunch room full of simple bench tables.  On the
north wall a rickety old door with hangs open; behind it is a playground for
the schoolhouse children on recess.  A hatch door has been integrated into
the floorboards, leading down into an oil lamp lit tunnel which opens up
into Villa Promenade; its large brass handle is rusty and very heavy, making
it quite a job to hoist it open.

A Room of Benches~
A single, long table stretches nearly from one end of the room to the
other, surrounded by equally long benches to either side.  At one end,
however, sits a rather comfortable-by-comparison chair for an adult to focus
attention on the eating manners of the students.  On the side of the table
opposite from the teacher's seat is an open window to the kitchen, where
servers may pass trays of nourishment to the children.  On the wall is a
menu.

Years of use has made the black chalkboard faded to charcoal at the head
of the classroom, behind the teacher's desk.  Equally worn crooked rows of
small children's desks line the classroom depicting the numbers of students
they have seen over the lifetime of Cradlenook.  
Something appears to be written on one of the children's desks.

A dull white picketed fence seperates the playground here from the rest
of the world, so the rambunctious children may play their childhood games in
relative peace.  The center of the playground has been reduced to mere dust
from the myriads of little footprints that've found their way etched into
the ground, while off to the side, a small swingset rests.

Eidolon Footpath~
A long path descending subtly towards the village graveyard gates slowly
turns from white cobblestone to soot black cobblestone.  As one moves on
down Eidolon Footpath, it may become noticeable that not many people take
the way to the graveyard.  The majority of the new villagers have no
relation to any of the dead, as it has been several decades since the
graveyard has been used.  Cradlenook must have been a bustling city, as the
graveyard is jam packed with headstones with no room left for any new dead.

Eidolon Footpath~
Slowly graying cobblestones extend onward to the old Cradlenook
graveyard.  The air feels damp and cool, and the lighting has darkened
drastically, as if the graveyard surroundings are not even remotely a part
of the happy little village to the south.  A stagnant smell of iron and
decaying plants fills the air; the graveyard must not be very well taken
care of.

Eidolon Footpath~
The thin trees that surround Cradlenook not far southward have grown
quite thick on either side of the path and have taken on the shape of great
maple trees; with each stroke forward their leaves darken and the shade
grows cooler and damper.  The cobblestones have turned into a dark soot
color; whether they've been painted like so, have not been maintained, or
have been so near to the graveyard that over time have become afflicted with
darkness, it is hard to say.

Metal gates painted every few months in rich silver and a glossy overcoat
are clasped shut, but a lock is amiss giving anyone the right to enter. 
Circling the mess of tombstones and dead flowers are iron-barred walls with
needle thin pointed spires.  Along the inside wall are neatly trimmed hedge
plants, possibly the only well maintained things in the entire yard.

A Desultory Row of Stone Epitaphs~
A desultory graveyard, obviously unkempt and dilapidated with age, opens
up before you in a large circle.  Tombstones have been placed randomly all
throughout the yard, bearing no pattern whatsoever.  Several of the epitaphs
are unreadable, even though they have all been carved right in the
gravestones; many appear jaded and unpolished.  Graves of all sizes have
been dug deep into the soil all over the place, but somehow all have managed
to keep out of the way of other graves.  A few expensive looking caskets
bound in a marble material rest upon plateaus of elevated land and carefully
carved bedrock.  The graves are not often visited and paid respects, for
most of the descendants and families of relation have died off over time;
the villa of Cradlenook has been in existence for ages.

A Desultory Row of Stone Epitaphs~
A strangely disorderly row of tombstones is scattered about in a mess. 
Upon each stone is carved a person of Cradlenook who long past died, and a
respectful epitaph beneath.  The tombstones are predominantly simple and
generic, only sanded down to create a smooth surface and top shaped like a
half moon.  A few of the stone tablets that tower over surrounding tombs and
are carved a bit more ornately; the entombed must have been more wealthy and
established in Cradlenook.  Many of the larger tombstones have engravings of
names prefixed with words such as Lady, Sir and Young Master.

A strangely disorderly row of tombstones is scattered about in a mess. 
Upon each stone is carved a person of Cradlenook who long past died, and a
respectful epitaph beneath.  The tombstones are predominantly simple and
generic, only sanded down to create a smooth surface and top shaped like a
half moon.  A few of the stone tablets that tower over surrounding tombs and
are carved a bit more ornately; the entombed must have been more wealthy and
established in Cradlenook.  Many of the larger tombstones have engravings of
names prefixed with words such as Lady, Sir and Young Master.

A Desultory Row of Stone Epitaphs~
Browned flowers which were once beautiful and vivid have wilted next to
their beloved tombstones and fallen limp in molded and mossy vases.  The
grass has grown thick between and over graves, making it very difficult to
see the names on tombstones and even worse trying not to step upon the
peacefully resting dead.  At this point it may be quite a hassle trying to
find one's way about the yard; a jargoned mess of stones and graves lies in
every direction.

The Secret Epitaph~
Amongst the chaotic rows of headstones, you have come across a very
special one.  Surrounded by weeds and muddy, crooked undergrowth roots, the
headstone glows in an eerie green light.  Upon the headstone an epitaph
reads, "{YHe Lived His Life Like a Constant Painting.{x" With the right word,
something special may happen at this very spot.

Midway between two different paths, Villa Promenade stretches out to the
east and west.  Northward the Mayor's home can be seen nestled in a circle
of thick trunked trees, before it a fine brick path lit by glistening
tear-shaped bulbs.  Small strands of grass and chunks of blanket-like moss
peek out and flourish between the cracks in the cobblestone path below. 
Overhead the sun shines down, ricocheting off the polished stones, creating
a blinding reflection into passerby eyes.

The sounds of ducks splashing in the basin just north can be heard dully

is a wooden door shrouded in long strands of meadow-like grass.  Cobblestone
rocks polished to a tee are cradled between grass on either side of the
promenade; their surfaces shine brilliantly in comparison to the other
passages around Cradlenook.

Inside the Schoolhouse Tunnel~
The schoolhouse tunnel resembles closely to a mini-mining passageway. 
Many have to creep down, back hunched, to make it through properly without
bumping into the ceiling.  Wooden steps have been crafted into the dirt
floor, and the walls have been packed with large stones to keep everything
in place.  Hanging from a long strip of wood on the ceiling are oil lamps to
keep the passage lit.  The air feels cool and damp, and them stones in the
walls are chilly to the touch, as the earth around them are keeping them
cool.  This passage is often used by teacher and student alike as a shortcut
into the city.

Brilliant white cobblestone tiles are pressed together along Villa

mountain can be seen.

impossible to see over even from standing at a distance.  Little man made

lies Wee Boulevard, home to all citizens of Cradlenook aside from the mayor.

Off of Villa Promenade shoots Wee Boulevard, stretching southward into a
small square of homes.  The cobblestone continues to the south, shining just
as brightly as it does on Villa Promenade.  On either side of the boulevard
is a slim margin of bright flowers that have been planted to make the street
look a bit more homely and alive.  Beyond the flower patches heading away
from Cradlenook is a rolling hill with maple trees shooting up from it.  On
the other side a small forested area has flourished, making for a fun play
area for the Cradlenook children.

A Verdant Path~
Lush green grass pads the earth just beyond Villa Promenade, making a
sharp cut between earth and cobblestone.  The sounds of birds chirping and
woodpeckers pecking away at tree bark is more resonant in these parts. 
Rustling noises in the surrounding bushes are apparent, and are probably
coming from that off forest floor creatures such as bunnies and snakes, and
from time to time, birds; they peck their beaks sporadically at seeds in the
soil and pull worms up from the dirt.  Off to the northwest a small cabbage
patch lies clobbered in healthy bunnies.

Tall stalks of grass and berry covered brambles make up the flourishing
path.  In some areas the grass sticks to your body.  Rubbing these blades of
grass from bottom to top is like sliding your fingers across adhesive
rubber.  Small spines on their surface make them tear away at any soft
fabric, leaving the material tousled and worn-looking.  Tiny creek toads can
be seen hopping through the moist spots in soil, relishing in the cool
earth.

Dense, overgrown grass comes up to an average human's knees along this

white chrysanthemums.  The surrounding bushes and undergrowth are
flourishing in an unstoppable frenzy; vines and bramble are wrapped around
tree trunks, sprouting tiny yellow flowers.  Moss covered rocks are strewn
through the undergrowth, half their mass hidden in the soil.

A Small Grassy Opening in the Forest~
A dilapidated stone archway stands about fifteen feet tall before a
grassy mountain.  Encompassing its base in a wide circle are beautiful white
and soft coral flowers.  The arc was built years ago by an artist who lived
on the street Wee Boulevard in Cradlenook.  Other art pieces of his are said
to be hidden within forested areas.  The body of earth just northward has
had conflicting names for as long as it existed, namely because of its
stature.  No one is quite sure if it is a mountain or a hill.  Some have
called it the vista hill because of its beautiful view of the treetops. 
Others have called it the the forest's-eye mountain.  It stands only sixty
feet into the air, but its mass is so large that it gives reason for some to
consider it a mountain.

A Gnome's Workshop Under the Stairs~
A small wooden desk littered with screws, springs and other contraptions
rests at the north end of the room, lit by a small oil lamp hanging
overhead.  In front of it a tiny gnome sits upon a wooden chair, kicking his
legs back and forth mindlessly, as they are not long enough to reach the
cabin floor.  A mess of plush blankets appears to have been thrown
carelessly in the corner of the room like a giant pillow; the gnome uses it
as a place to sleep.  The room appears to be nothing more than a simple work
shop, scattered with junk and trinket making tools; to the gnome, however,
it is a place of paradise.

A gigantic stretching shadow spans nearly half the southern boulevard,

so cool it almost feels wet, and is somewhat shocking on bare skin.  Where
homes have not yet progressed, trees take up the expanse.  A few yards host
cherry trees which, in the summer, bloom so much that the entire Wee
Boulevard makes of it a chore to pick them and have a bit of a picnic in the
bowl center of the hill to the north.

Its roof is painted a misfit of colors: red, yellow, brown, black.  Its
almost as if the owners of the house were too poor to buy enough paint at a

not far north and heads back around the square or north to Villa Promenade.

Where the cobblestone meets the lavish green grass, a steep rolling slope

which a children's schoolhouse and playground reside.  The slope is so steep
and bears no tree roots that it may be a nearly impossible climb without
some proper hiking boots.  At the very bottom of the slope a bowl shaped
basin delves into the earth; it encompasses a dark, shallow pool of water.

Just before you a circle of cool, refreshing water is cupped in the

the basin's water, giving it proper nutrients.  A small circle of soft grass
around the basin offers a place for resting, making it possible to sit at
the basin's egg and dip one's feet into its cool surface.

The basin slopes gradually to a maxim of about three feet deep in the

rainfall and the coalescence of dribbling water in the grass, swans have
made it their humble home.  One may also notice the silvery glint of a fish
scale zipping by in the water.  Children have taken fish from other streams
in nearby forests and dumped them into the basin.

Birds have nested in a single, tall, tawny tree; its trunk is so thin that
it could very well fit in with a cluster of beach trees and an average human
could touch ring finger to thumb around its center.

stone.  Rumor has it that the stone has secret healing powers and that the
sick have come to the top of this mountain and prayed to be cured of
illness, and to avail they were.  Down the backside of the mountain a
waterfront is visible just beyond a row of trees.  The sound of water

Nearing a House Upon a Hill~
Northwest from the cornfield, a wide path leading to a beautiful white
house stretches in a hook shaped curve.  Lining the path on either side are
rows of daisies, the house tenant's favorite flower.  At the end of the path
two tall silver posts stand, one on either side, topped with human head
sized bulbs which are perfectly round and glowing brightly.  The trees are
thick around the path, making it impossible to see anything but a portion of
the house ahead and a bit of the cobblestone below.

A Beautiful White House Upon a Hill~
Nearly equivalent to the grandeur of the mayor's home, the Falook's
radiates a rich and classy aura.  Grandfather clocks, heavily polished oak
tables, comfortable leather upholstery, and mint looking brown carpet makes
up most of the house.  The Falook's generally keep the house in a quiet and
controlled environment; even when parties are thrown and several drinks are
consumed, only the lowest chuckle and chortle emit from party guest voices;
they are quite possibly the most prude beings in Cradlenook.

A Small Shanty~
Nearly everything in here is blanketed in a thick layer of dust.  It is
almost as if you had walked into a winter wonderland.  No cleaning supplies
exist in this awful, stagnant-aired shanty.  The only upholstery in the
entire shanty, which consists of a single room, is a smelly old yarn couch
with stuffing poking out on nearly every inch of it, a wooden stump used as
a makeshift chair, and a three-legged wooden table, which appears to have
been chewed on each corner by a dog or some other animal with sharp teeth. 
From the light on the ceiling an enormous drapery of a spider webs hang,
attaching themselves to each corner of the room.  Tossed in a rampant mess
are shattered beer bottles and coke cans; the tenant of the shanty may very
well be an alcoholic as the room suggests.  Upon the windowsill a row of
disorderly bottles both large and small, all alcohol based, rest, each
collecting dust.  Sleeping here {ycannot{x be healthy, as the dust is so thick
staying for a short period of time could cause anyone to catch a cold.

A Log House~
A simple little log house opens up before you.  Nearly every piece of
upholstery is made of oakwood, and it is obvious that each piece was crafted
with loving hands.  The arms of the wooden chairs curl at the ends into
small swirls, tightening until only a pin could fit through the center.  The
neck rests on each chair are carved and sanded so beautifully that it almost
looks as though someone had taken a scroll and ironed it into a perfectly
shaped cylinder roll.  Two large oil lamps hang from the east and west
walls, and a single bronze oil lamp shaped like a gravy dispenser rests on a
table next to a padded wooden couch.  On the far wall a pair of bush buck
horns hangs perfectly center and straight; below it on a long wooden table
is a set of hunting gear: a bow and arrow, a sheathed knife, and a pair of
camouflage trousers.  On the eastern wall below a hearth of thin sticks is a
stone fireplace blocked off with a metal net.

A Maroon-Roofed Chalet~
The exterior of the chalet is shaped like a gigantic, thin triangle, its
roof sloping at a steep, quick angle.  The roof shingles have been painted a
dark shade of maroon along with the window shutters.  Carved in the shutters
are large, round hearts.  Nearly blocking any sunlight from coming in
through the front window is a filled out cherry tree; its thin branches
dance in the gentle breeze.  Inside the home in various places are small
bowls of candy and goodies.  The air smells somewhat geriatric as if elderly
folks have been living here for ages.  A cat bowl with the words Lyllie
across the front rests before a window, crammed full with star shaped cat
food.  A soft spun wool couch rests up against the far wall before a coffee
table of magazines and books.  Pictures rest on each windowsill, in each of
them are children and young adults, probably family to the tenants of the
chalet.  The overall feel of the room suggests that the folks who live here
are kindhearted, welcoming people.

The Path to the Mayor's House~
Fine red brick is packed into the earth as a walkway to the mayor's
living quarters.  On either side of the path, small bulbs of light are
placed in the grass every two feet as guides for night time strollers.  Well
fertilized grass is laid out all around the house and kept perfectly
trimmed.  Beyond the path, a beautiful, white two story home stands taller
than a normal two story home.  The rooftop reaches far beyond any
surrounding trees.  Green strands of heavy garland hang from the front porch
banisters in the shape of a stretched letter U.  The porch stretches all
the way around the home in a giant square; upon it are rich cedar benches
which have been polished to perfection.  The stairs leading up to the front
porch are about fifteen feet wide and thin, like giant slabs of fine cut
cement.  A crystal fixture which looks like a mini-chandelier, hangs from
the ceiling before the great wooden door as a welcome light.  Surrounding
the door to the left, top and right, are three windows; the window over the
door is shaped like a half-moon and through it can be seen a twisting
staircase which leads to the second floor.  Behind the closed white curtains
lights can be seen turned on, glowing and filling the house with a warm
golden light.

The Mayor's House~
Undoubtedly the richest and largest house in all of Cradlenook is the
mayor's home.  A twisting staircase lies directly ahead of the front door
beyond a rich tawny rug.  The soft sounds of a grand piano can be heard
floating from room to room, but it is difficult to decipher which room it is
coming from exactly.  To the left of the staircase is a white wall covered
in brilliant paintings; beyond it, a large dining room with a table that
could fit twenty rests, taking up about half the room.  A large leafy
wreathe sprinkled with berries and a candle in the middle, have been placed
in the center for looks.  A low rumbling sound from a kitten's throat can be
heard in the living room on west.

A grand dining table fit to seat twenty people stretches across the
dining room, its wider half parallel to the western wall.  A large leafy
wreathe sprinkled with berries and a candle in the middle has been placed
in the center for looks.  Much like every other main room in the house, a
crystalline chandelier hangs from the ceiling above the table.  Two chairs
noticeably larger than any of the other chairs rest at both ends of the
table, signifying where the mayor and his wife are seated for meals.

The Living Room~
Fine brick red leather couches with not a crease in the upholstery make a
half square about a shiny wooden coffee table.  A large bay window,
sprinkled with heavily stuffed white pillows that have ruse, tasseled
corners, is set into the front of the room, overlooking the porch and the
brick path to the house.  A fresh bowl of fruit rests on the coffee table,
overflowing with grapes, apples, and bananas.  From time to time a butler
strides into the living room, replacing the perfectly good fruit with
another bowl hardly a wee bit fresher.  A crystal chandelier hangs from the
middle of the room, casting rainbow colored patches of light about the room.
The brilliant white carpet is in mint condition, it almost appears as if the
house is brand new.

A Long Hall Clad in Paintings~
Rich, polished cedar planks make up the floor of the hall; they have been
polished so much that walking in socks would be a dangerous idea, and one
could easily slip and fall.  Large bordered paintings hang perfectly level
on the white walls, each encompassing beautiful green landscapes and past
mayors of Cradlenook.  Silver candle holsters are nailed on the walls every
five feet, producing a warm guiding light to the mayor's bedroom.  A tall
elegant hutch mounted with large, leather bound books is backed against the
wall at the end of the hall next to the top of the staircase.  Upon it a
book reading How to Mayor for Dummies rests; from it, one could infer that
like many other politicians of Thera, the mayor has little knowledge of how
to uphold a city, but nevertheless, has the most beautiful and rich home in
the entire village; how odd.

The Mayor's Bedroom~
A king size bed made of solid, bleached white oak rests up against the
north wall below a wide window; the view from the window overlooks a short
span of Villa Promenade and the bulb lit path leading up to the mayor's
home.  Brown painted walls surround the off white carpeted room of which the
mayor has made his bedroom quarters.  Hardwood furniture is pushed up
against each wall.  On the western wall a gigantic bookcase buried in
leather bound and hardcover books rests, spanning nearly the entire length
of the wall.  On the eastern wall a desk with a silver metal lamp on it
rests with a chain dangling from the light cap; below it a stack of papers
rests, some of them have signatures scribbled across a wide blank space on
the bottom of the page.  On the southern wall beyond the foot of the bed and
to the left of a gigantic closet is a grandfather clock; it appears brand
new, but has been in this room for ages.

Merchant Lane - 200 N~
A mixture of smells wafts into the air through Merchant Lane.  The most
prominent of smells, as it is nearest by 200 N, is the smell of raw meat and
animal blood.  Not far southward a butcher's shop stands where it has been
for ages and ages, but has taken on new names over time as owners have
passed on.  The cobblestone from Villa Promenade continues on down the
curving path here and off beyond a large group of stalking trees.

Merchant Lane - 190 S~
The sound of hacking kitchen knives, though still distant, comes clearer
with each step southward.  The smell of raw meat becomes a bit more brutal
and thick in the air as well.  From time to time the butchery door creeks
open and slams shut as citizens and passerby of Cradlenook come stalking out
with a thin white wrapping about a slab of raw meat cradled in their arms. 
On either side of the path tall pine trees grow, their sappy smell mixing in
with the scent of blood.  When not maintained, the path appears like a giant
green mess; pine needles spindle and fall from the surrounding trees and
land in a messy heap on the cobblestones.

Merchant Lane - 180 E~
Chop, chop, chop, goes the butcher's knife to the south.  The noise is
almost disturbing; it sounds somewhat of a fleshy hack.  From here a mess of
smells wafts into your nostrils: fresh subs, lmaonade powder drinks,
vegetarian salad, raw meat.  The surrounding trees waver a bit in the fickle
wind, sending a cool breeze through the curves of the lane and pine needles
spinning to the cobblestone.  A one story wooden building to the south
stretches longer along the sides than it does on the front.  Its surface was
at one time painted, but has not been maintained in many years, so now
appears a bit dilapidated in its old age.

Merchant Lane - 170 E~
Branching off to the north and the east, the lane ends.  Much fresher
smells are apparent here verses near the butchery where blood and raw meat
smells are thick in the air.  A modest little bakery stands to the north in
all its one story glory, its exterior painted in a soft pink color, and the
roof shingles painted a brilliant white.  The cobblestone of the lane ends
where it meets up with large, black stone slabs leading to the bakery
entrance.  Grey stone slabs are cut and set into the soil in front of the
sub shop and outlined in a misfit variety of brilliantly vivid flowers.

An overload of pink meets your eyes upon entry to Aleya's bakery.  Bright
pink curtains sheath every window, casting pink lighting onto the hard white
carpet.  Even the circular customer tables have been painted pink.  A glass
case encompasses a variety of different foods that have been specially
prepared in the bakery.  A jar atop the case holds a dozen swirly lollerpops
on wooden sticks.  A frilly smell which resembles roses wafts through the
bakery and meets your nose strongly as a curtain flickers on a window,
pushing in a breeze.

The Local Butcher's Shop~
Hanging from the ceiling behind a bloody white counter are racks of lamb,
cow and pigs.  Any vegetarian would do well to steer clear of Alrich's
butchery for that reason.  Blood drips savagely from the animal carcasses
onto the knife strewn white table, staining it in a bright red color, which
transforms into a dark brown over time.  A rounded glass case is built onto
the front of the white table displaying all the slaughtered meats in
paper-backed baskets.  From time to time a worker scampers through the shop,
spraying an air freshener to keep the room from smelling completely dank,
but it doesn't seem to be working very well.

Two enormous bread ovens stand backed up against the far wall.  On either
side of them two bare tables are built; they appear to have been recently
cleaned as they shine wetly.  A hole in the sub making buffet is edged with
mayonnaise, it must be used for sub scraps.  Periodically a sharp binging
noise rings out in the shop, signifying the success of more freshly risen
loaves of bread.  Posters line the walls, some of them portraying sub
specials such as the seafood sensation and the pizza sub.  On either side of
the entryway small tables made for two people have been set up.  A paper
sign hangs from a ceiling fan which reads, '{gEnjoy Jared's specially made

Attempting to climb the rock would be nearly impossible; it would take
incredible climbing skills to make it successfully to the top.  Small stone
ledges only a few centimeters wide protrude from its surface, giving it a
somewhat jagged appeal.  At the top, large blades of grass hang limply over
the edge of the cliff, making it look as though the edge of the earth had
been reached.  Atop the cliff is a house which looks quite close in
resemblance to a beach house.

{DA Stone Cliff{x~
Overlooking the square-shaped Wee Boulevard, the cliff stands about
seventy feet tall and hovers above an expanse of grass.  Thick strands of
healthy green grass drape the edge of the cliff like the trimming of a yarn
blanket, and in places dirt-covered roots can be seen poking out like
crooked fingers.  Just north lies a house which could very well fit in next
to a row of beach houses on a lakeside.  A large timbered porch with a
white-net hammock and wooden swing juts out from its face, and in the very
center a simple white-painted, wooden door is swung open with a thin screen
in the entryway to keep out bugs.  Two mini-gardens have been planted on
either side of the walkway before the house, consisting of daisies, orchids,
lilies, and gigantic sunflowers.  From the edge of the cliff, the
bowl-shaped center of Wee Boulevard beyond the circle of trees is visible.

A lovely scent of roses reaches your nostrils as soon as you've entered
the house.  Simple white vases rest upon shelves, windowsills and tables,
holding fresh smelling flowers and roses.  Upon a short wicker table before
a padded wooden bench is a small, sparkling, golden sandcastle and a bowl of
metallic and dull-colored shells.  A warm breeze grades through the screen
door every now and then, ruffling papers and pages from open magazines and
books that lie on a simple wooden shelf on the eastern wall.  A queen sized
mattress lies on the floor on the western corner, covered in a patchwork
quilt; upon the mattress is a worn, tawny teddy bear, a pair of square brown
glasses, and an unfinished book that the tenant has been plotting away at
for several weeks.  A ladder in the eastern corner of the room pokes through
the ceiling and gives way to the beach house roof.
