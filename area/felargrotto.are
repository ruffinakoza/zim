{^K{6ir{^a{6'{^s {5Ca{%ve{x~
You are in a cave overlooking {&Felar Grotto{x.  The view is absolutely
breathtaking.  You hear the sounds of rushing waterfalls and singing birds. 
The walls of the cave are covered in a light pink satin, and there there is
a window on the northern wall looking out onto the {BL{ba {BC{boeur {Bd{be {Bl{ba {BM{ber{x.  A
picture of {&Sadin {xhangs on the western wall with lovely {^crystal {xroses
encrusting the edges.  There's an oversized couch overflowing with plush
pillows and blankets.  Silky furs and rugs lie all around the room.  This is
the place to relax.  Rumor has it that the great {5f{%e{5lar {xherself comes to
lounge here sometimes.

{&Just {7Beyond {&the {8Great Iron Gates{x~
You've taken one step north of the entrance to the grotto and a
subtle sense of light and purity washes over you as if cleansing
your soul of impurities and evil. A grassy path is just ahead of
you, well lit and welcoming. The sky is cloudless from straight
overhead. Every day in the Grotto seems like a {%perfect {^day{x.

Thin {&Victorian {xgates are showered with beautiful {1rose {xbuds and
plush, flowing {2vines{x. Every direction you look there are flowers
and beautiful spruce. This {2forest {xgives off an aura that makes you

There is a great story behind this {2forest{x, as there is to the {2forest{x

make yourself at home as well, for you are greatly welcomed.

Rusted {1bronze {xgates allow your entrance if you can cut through the
thick vines and brushwood that has made its way into your path as
to make your journey far more difficult.  Dead plants, dead trees,
dead undergrowth, the stench of stuffy air, and saddened, bitter
cries are all around you.  Upon entering, watch your step, for the
things you take as being dead, are only watching your every move,
in hopes to pull you down into the underbrush.

{#Abnormally {&Tall {%Cat {5Tails{x~
It looks as though these cat tails were planted by farmers.
They are so carefully spread apart from each other by about
a foot for rows and rows and are as tall as the eye can see
that you wonder what kind of water they soak up with the
powerful roots. The roots go down for a dozen feet to keep
them tightly snug in the ground. Make your way into the next
set of {%cat {5tails{x and beware the creatures that make this place
their home. They're friendly yet jumpy and don't allow others
to invade their precious personal space.

The cat tails are starting to thin out here. A clear vision

the way the ocean moves, as if it isn't real. All around you
are cat tails of a rich green. These cat tails, if you haven't
noticed, are magical. They morph into the colors of the creatures

Made out of cobblestone and expensive, solid oak, this bridge overlooks
La Couer de la Mer. It extends as far as the eye allows. Looking into the
distance, passerby's can be seen, coming into view. The fog and mist are

are being pulled by horses and strong, busty felines, full of delicious

How romantic! The sand sticks under your feet gently and a quiet
undertone of waves thrashing is heard not far away. Take one more
step north to indulge a refreshing swim in the famous {$La Mer{x. Off
in the distance is a wafting hazy cloud, it travels above the bridge
but mostly just above the water. A wavering flag can be seen poking
out above it all.

In the shade of the willow, reconciliation can be found in this place
of misery. The memories of those lost in the battle of the King's throne
have been etched into the bark of this willow, and no matter how hard
the felars of this forest try to cut the tree down, it seems to have an
impenetrable force around it, and refuses to be carried away. It is
a medal of honor for the felars who stood up for what is lawful, and
you will not see many evils hanging around it.

Everything here is covered in dark red blood. Something was
slaughtered here without mercy. The smell is overwhelming
but you still trudge through. Intestines are stretched throughout
the limbs of the trees, dripping with blood. Some strange animal's
skin has been crudely nailed to the nearest, and bloodiest, tree. Near
the base of the tree, tooth after tooth lie, stained blood red from the
beating this animal had taken. The ground has been flung about,
showing the animal did put up a fight before its untimely demise.
In the distance you can hear another shriek as some other animal
is meeting the same fate.

The grass here is matted down in spots, looks like something
sleeps here. Again, the trees have no bark, only deep cuts and
scratches that make you quiver in your armor. The lush forest
around this opening makes it hard to see more then eight feet
in any direction. In the middle of this darkened area is a small
lit candle near some shredded old books. The title of the only
readable cover says "Blood Mystics." You read some of the
torn pages, and it talks all about casting necromancer spells,
sacrificial rituals, and self mutilation. This is a strange area
indeed.
