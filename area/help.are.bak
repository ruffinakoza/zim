-1 0 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly
copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins
are worth 100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the
pound, as opposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  Gems can be bought to
alleviate weight problems from the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10%
more than they are worth.  10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth
more than 100 gold pieces for the highest quality stones.  
~
0 0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~
-1 0 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~
0 0 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
PROMPT SHOW will show your current prompt.
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard prompt.
 
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.
 
        %h :  Display your current hits

-1 0 DEATH CORPSE MORGUE~
When your character dies, your spirit is reincarnated back to the
altar of the temple in your hometown. Your {&corpse{x is left behind
in the room that you were killed in, along with all of your things.
{x
After you die, you become a '{#ghost{x' for the next few game hours,
during which time nothing will attack you.  This allows you to
retrieve your equipment when you are killed by an aggressive mobile.
If you do not retrieve your corpse in time, it will decay and all
of your belongings will show up in the {&donation pit{x. ({!15{x minutes is
about how long it takes for your corpse to decay.)
{x 
Death does not affect groups or those following you.
{x
You lose roughly 2/3's of the experience you had earned towards your
next level, and every third death you lose one point of constitution.
Constitution lost due to dying is retrainable.

Heroes may buy constitution points from Questus if they are below their max
con and have no trains left and fewer than 10 practices.

PC corpses decay eventually, after roughly 30 minutes of real time.
{x
(We do not have a morgue.)
~
0 0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set
amount of experience points for each leve based on your class and race.
 
You gain experience by:
 
   killing monsters
   being part of a group that kills a monster (if you are in the same room)
   improving your skills
   doing retrieval quests for Questus
 
You lose experience by:
 
   fleeing combat
   dishonoring (help '{CDISHONOR{x')
   recalling out of combat
   being the target of certain spells
   dying
 
The experience you gain from combat is affected by several factors:
 
   higher charisma means higher morale, and is a better learning environment
   a leader with high charisma improves morale of the group
   killing those aligned against you (good killing evil, evil killing good)
      will give you a very nice bonus.
   killing monsters higher than your level.
 
Groups:
 
   Groups split their exp based on your level in the group.  Beyond that
   they get both the morale bonus for a charismatic leader, and up to 20%
   bonus for grouping.  While the exp is split, a group of adventurers
   kills monsters much more quickly, and needs far less time to rest
   between battles.
~
0 0 COLOR COLOUR ANSI~
Syntax: toggle color             Toggles color mode on/off

You may also talk in color; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a color is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{x     reset, returns to default

         {r{{r     red     {m{{m     magenta
         {g{{g     green   {c{{c     cyan
         {y{{y     yellow  {w{{w     white
         {b{{b     blue    {D{{D     grey{x

For brighter colors, use the shifted letters: {RR{GG{YY{BB{MM{CC{WW{x
When using color, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
color it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the color is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

Other {{? sequences are:
         {{*     beep    {{\     new line
         {{z     reset to previous color

Color is courtesy of Lope from Loping Through The MUD.

~
92 0 TICK~
Syntax: Tick (area/mob/obj/player)
 
The command tick is used to make objects/mobs/players/areas reset.
 
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 106 sec. if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

{RAll names are also subject to Immortal approval.{x

~
0 0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>
(For Ranged) Syntax: cast <spell> <direction>.<target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

~
0 0 EXITS~

'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>

it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~
0 0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

If you are affected by pass door spell then you can flee passing the 
closed doors.

You cannot flee to inside of the clans when you are fighting with the 
clan guardians.
 
If you are Samurai, after level 10 you can NOT FLEE,so be careful.(You may 
flee if victim's level is much higher than your level (level difference is
6). But you won't wimp out.)

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~
0 0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~
0 0 TELL REPLY SAY GTELL ;~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>

0 0 QUIT RENT SAVE~

Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object. The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving. Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
You do not need to save. Every save operation requested by the players 
causes lag.  The D&D auto saver does not cause even the tiniest bit of lag.

Some objects, such as keys and some maps, may not be saved. Those very 
powerful items of very limited number, are not saved if you are below 
level 10.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

careful when you DENY somebody. DENY can only be removed by editing the
user file.
A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.

location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of

is an echo.

Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

these dimunitive beings are well known for their great wisdom.  The most
distinctive feature of a Rock Gnome are their enormous noses.  The size of a
Rock Gnome's nose is a matter of some status among their fellows, and one is
proud to boast having the largest proboscis.  Rock Gnomes tend to care
little for the world of politics, and will remain neutral in most matters. 
Though they can not see as well in the dark as their cousins, the
Svirfneblin, they are also gifted with innate infravision.  
 
~
-1 0 'STORM GIANT' STORMGIANTS~
Storm giants are easily the largest of the giants, growing from 12-20
feet in height.  Due to their size, storm giants are gifted with
extraordinary strength and stamina, receiving , enhanced damage, and bash
for free.  Their size, however, makes them rather clumsy.  They are
particularly skilled in the use of swords, and will find that they are
capable of wielding any two-handed weapon in one hand with ease.  The slow
minds make them susceptable to mental attacks, and they do not tolerate
extremes of heat or cold well.  Storm giants are naturally resistant to
lightning though, and like cloud giants, they are able to fly continously. 
As any of the other giant races, they will find themselves best suited to
train as a warrior, a profession in which they excel.  Storm giants are well
known for their dedication to the preservation of goodness and their
loathing for evil.  
 
~
-1 0 'FIRE GIANT' FIREGIANTS~

free.  They are particularly skilled in the use of swords, and will find
that they are able to wield any two-handed weapon in one hand easily.  Their
size does affect them negatively, making them rather clumsy, also causing
them to take additional damage from lightning.  Their slow minds make them
vulnerable to all forms of mental attack, but they are naturally resistant
to heat and take little damage from fire attacks.  Fire giants are not
accustomed to extreme temperatures of cold and will find that they take more
damage from cold attacks.  Like any other race of giant, they will find
themselves best suited to train as a warrior, a profession in which they
excel.  Fire giants are notoriously evil and have great difficulty in
obeying the law.  
~
-1 0 'CLOUD GIANT' 'CLOUD GIANTS' CLOUDGIANTS~
Cloud giants are the smallest race of giants, ranging in size from 9-14

and bash for free.  They are particularly skilled in the use of swords, and
will find that they are capable of wielding any two-handed weapon in one
hand with ease.  Their size does affect them negatively, however, making
them rather clumsy, and causing them to take additional damage from
lightning attacks.  Their slow minds make them susceptable to mental
attacks.  However their ethereal bodies give them resistance to weapons, and
cause them to continuously float above the ground.  Like any other race of
giant, they will find themselves best suited to train as a warrior, a
profession in which they excel.  Cloud giants are a neutral race, desiring a
balance of good and evil in the world.  
~
-1 0 'FROST GIANT' FROSTGIANTS~

extraordinary strength and stamina, receiving fast healing, enhanced damage,
and bash.  They are particularly skilled in the use of swords, and will find
that they are able to wield a two-handed weapon easily in one hand.  Also
due to their large size, they take extra damage from lightning, and are
rather clumsy.  Their slow minds make them vulnerable to all forms of mental
attack, but they are naturally resistant to the cold and take little damage
from cold attacks.  Frost giants, however, can not tolerate extreme
temperatures of heat and take extra damage from fire attacks.  Frost giants,
like any other giant race, will find themselves best suited to train as a
warrior.  Frost giants are notoriously evil and have great difficulty in
obeying the law.

Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They

ill-suited for any other profession. Giants, due to their size and 
stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for free.

they are able to choose and excel in any profession with equal ease.  
 
~
-1 0 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves hold a high opinion of themselves and their capabilities.  Elves
are too frail for their liking, orcs are overly dirty, trolls overly smelly.
Humans overly...  Hairless Dwarves value strength and heartiness above most
other attributes, being that they feel they are born of the earth.  Being no
stranger to subterranean life, dwarvenkind is better at seeing in the dark
than most.  Dwarves tend to have ruddy-hued skin and hair, as well as almost
always sport a full beard, if male.  A common misconception is that dwarves
are exceedingly short, which isn't the case.  They tend to range from 4.5
feet to 5.5 feet, but are inordinately thick in build, giving rise to such
a misconception.  Dwarves are also naturally resistant to poison and
disease.  
~
-1 0 ELF ELVES~
Elves are slightly taller than most humans, but have a much lighter
build.  They lack the strength and stamina of many other races, but are far
more agile in body and mind.  Due to their magic nature, elves resist charm
spells most effectively, but are burned by the cold touch of iron, and shun
its use in their careers.  Elves are notoriously hard to spot and their
light footfalls difficult to hear.  They see well in the night due to their
infravision and feel at home in a dark forest.
 
~
-1 0 'HALF-ELF' HALFELF HALFELVES~
Half-elves have both human and elven blood flowing through their veins. 
They resemble thin, medium height humans with distinctly pointed elven ears,
and have similiar strengths.  Half-elves have the dexterity and intelligence
of an elf, but are more frail than humans.  They have inherited a natural
resistance to charm and infravision from their elven side, but have lost the
ability to move silently like their fullblooded cousins.  Burned by its
touch, half-elves shun the use of iron equipment.  
 
~
-1 0 SVIRFNEBLIN DEEP-GNOME~
Svirfneblin, also known as Deep Gnomes, spend most of their lives
underground, mining ore from the earth.  Years spent in harsh and unfavorable
conditions deep underground have given them a natural resistance to poison
and disease, along with natural infravision.  Svirfneblin also have a
natural resistance to magic which stands them in good stead while
experimenting with new spellcasting techniques as they are apt to do.  All
gnomes are small, averaging 4-5 feet in height.  Their diminutive size puts
them at big disadvantage when facing larger opponents and they find that
they are easily bashed, taking great damage from those attacks.  Svirfneblin
care nothing for society, and politics bore them, thus they remain neutral
in all matters.  
 
~
-1 0 FELAR FELARS~
Felar are a catlike race of humanoids.  Much larger than the average
human, a felar will grow 6-8 feet in height.  Along with their size, they
have great strength and very quick reflexes.  Being the magical creatures
that they are, Felar are resistant to lightning attacks, and have natural
infravision.  They are covered with a thick coating of fur, which makes them
resistant to the cold, but vulnerable to fire.  Their fear of drowning is
well known, and they avoid entering any water unless they are absolutely
forced to.  
 
~
-1 0 DUERGAR GREY-DWARF GREYDWARF~
Grey Dwarves, more commonly known as Duergar, are a subterranean race
whose murderous exploits have brought them to the surface to pillage.  Like
all Dwarves, they have a natural resistance to poison, disease, infravision,
and an unreasoning fear of water.  Years spent dabbling in the dark arts
have also given them a strong resistance to magic.  Duergar are adept
thieves, their high dexterity a compliment to their cunning minds and sharp
intellect.  Hatred for all that is good and a desire to cause destruction
mark them as a truly evil race 
 
~
-1 0 DARK ELF DARKELF DARKELVES DARK-ELF DROW~
Dark-Elves, more commonly known as Drow, are renegade surface elves who
have fled into the dark caverns beneath the earth to escape the restrictive
confines of ordered society.  They retain similiar strengths to their fair
cousins, with high intellect and great dexterity, and are also light of
build.  They bear yet the natural elven resistance to charm spells,
infravision, and the ability to move swiftly and silently without being
noticed.  But their hearts, like their skin, are as black as night, and a
drow elf will go out of his way to cause pain and suffering to another.  
 
~
-1 0 SATYR SATYRS~
Satyr are a half-human, half-goat race of pleasure loving creatures. 
Known for their wild and carefree spirit, they greatly love chasing women
and strong drink.  They have roughly the same strengths as a human, but much
greater dexterity.  Living in the forest for many years has given them a
resistance to disease, and they will find that wooden weapons have
difficulty piercing their tough hides.  Keen eyesight, combined with natural
infravision, places them among the first to become aware of trouble.  
 
~
-1 0 GITHYANKI GITHYANKIS~
Githyanki are an extraplanar race of evil humanoids.  Their skin is
leathery and yellow, sharp fangs are revealed when they laugh.  They are
endowed with a natural ability to see in the darkness and have no
vulnerabilities.  Githyanki excel in any profession they choose and are a
well rounded race.  
~
-1 0 ROCKSEER ROCKSEERS~
Rockseer, like the Drow, have abandoned life above ground to live beneath
the surface.  Rockseer, unlike the Drow, are not inherently evil, the world
of politics, government and society does not concern them and they remain
neutral in all matters.  They spend their entire lives dedicated to tending
rock gardens deep in the caverns of the Underdark, though a few have been
known to journey to the surface.  Years spent working with rocks have given
Rockseer a unique ability to walk through stones and to meld into them. 
Combined with their naturally high dexterity, a Rockseer's ability to meld
into stone gives them an excellant armor class rating.  Due to the unique
nature of their flesh, Rockseer shun the use of wooden weapons or equipment
as it causes them pain.  Rockseer, like all true elves, bear a resistance to
charm, have infravision, and are able to move silently without being seen.  
 
~
-1 0 TROLL TROLLS~
Long hidden within the sanctity of their mountain caves, a race known in
the past only as myth, lies the civilization of the trolls.  Built with the
undying stamina which any mountaindweller seems to have, these green skinned
beasts often grow to obtain a state of health few other races believed
possible.  Hindered by their slow intellect and mobility, the troll society
seems to have decided as a whole to rejoin the races of the realms, moving
out of their sanctuaries in numbers reaching high into the thousands

-1 0 RANGERS~
Outdoorsmen, hunters, and masters of woodcraft, rangers are the dwellers
of the wild.  In addition to having excellent fighting skills, they are
wielders of some powerful dweomers.  Some rangers have been known to call
large bears to their aid, fashion powerful staffs, and have the ability to
camouflage themselves beyond detection.  Their ability to ambush their
opponents makes them deadly foes.  
~
-1 0 NINJA NINJAS~
Masters of the art of weaponless combat, these mysterious warriors have
recently become more common in the land.  A ninja prides himself in his
ability to strike quickly and silently before fading into the shadows,
learning the art of assassination through rigorous training.  Ninja believe
that it is a loss of honor to touch blades with their opponent, and will
never parry a blow.  In addition to a diverse repertoire of fighting
abilities, ninja have use of a strange magic, spells that no wizard today is
capable of duplicating.  
 
~
-1 0 'ANTI-PALADINS ANTIPALADINS'~
The unholy counterpart to a paladin, these chaotic knights have chosen
evil as their course.  Combining superb fighting skills with a large
reportoire of necromantic spells makes an anti-paladin a deadly opponent. 
Anti-paladins are utterly ruthless and delight in the terror and suffering
that their presence brings.  
~
-1 0 PALADIN PALADINS~
These warriors have chosen the path of virtue and chivalry above all
others.  This dedication to their cause grants them priest-like spells and
healing powers.  They are also formidable fighters, always questing to stamp
out evil.  Paladins must stay good in order to cast their spells.  Those who
forsake goodness are strongly frowned upon.  Paladins are the epitome of all
that is good and true, and they will gladly sacrifice their lives for their
beliefs.  
 
~
-1 0 CLERIC CLERICS~
Clerics are the most defensively oriented of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat 
spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the 
best class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

~
-1 0 THIEF THIEVES~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

~
-1 0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

~
-1 0 'SAMURAI'~
The mighty samurai warriors have travelled to these realms from a distant
continent.  A samurai swears absolute loyalty to his Lord, acting as a
retainer and enforcer.  Honor, above all else, is their credo.  A true
samurai will not flee from combat as it brings dishonor to them.  A samurai
does not take defeat lightly, and may take his own life if he fails in
battle too many times.  
 
Note: Samurai are a highly advanced class to play.  If you are a beginner, it
is strongly recommended that you choose a different class to play.  Samurai
become very powerful at the higher levels, however, if they die 11 times, they
will automatically DELETE themselves.  In addition, once a samurai has passed
level 10 he will no longer flee from fights unless the character he is fighting
is much stronger than him, in which case he can use the dishonor command to
escape the fight.

~
-1 0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
These undead beings are ancient warriors, well versed in the use of
necromantic magic.  A vampire during the day will pass for an ordinary human
being, but by night will often revert to their true undead form.  As a
vampire transforms, his body increases in size, gains additional strength,
renders him immune to negative energies, and allows him to gain sustenance
from the lifeblood of his victims.  A vampire's flesh burns under the touch
of natural, and some magical light, causing them great pain.  They can never
escape their true identify fully, and although players cannot recognize them
in their unchanged state, monsters know them to be lifeless undead and will
not attack them.

~
-1 0 NECROMANCERS~
Deemed as a failed attempt to learning the intricacies of life through
the Source by goodly clerics, necromancy is a powerful art used to trap
spirits into the form of flesh and bone.  Few have love for necromancers and
their ability to amass powerful undead allies, for even the least evil of
necromancers are usually too mad to realize the evil they perform.  Even
though their armies are quite powerful, necromancers themselves are found to
be rather weak.  
~
-2 0 HOMETOWN HOMETOWNS~
You can pick from one of seven cities as your hometown
New Thalos
Midgaard
Old Midgaard
Titan Valley
Fayten Keep
 
New Thalos and Midgaard are for All alignments.
Fayten Keep is restricted to Good Alignment.
Old Midgaard is for the Vampire and Necromancer Class
Titan Valley is for the Giant Races
 
 
Your hometown is where you will recall to and is where the pit
is to which your corpse will decay and be deposited in.
Everyone starts at the Mud School, Which is connected to each
of the hometowns.
~
-1 0 ETHOS~
You may pick a Lawful, Neutral or Chaotic ethos.  This shows your opinion
toward the laws of the land (not the rules).  If you plan on obeying the
laws no matter what, you take a lawful ethos, if you will obey the laws
some of the time, then you are neutral.  If you plan on breaking the laws
and only obeying them when you just happen to obey the laws, then you are
chaotic.  Ethos can only be set once.

-2 0 'NEWBIE INFO' NEWBIE~
{RWelcome Newbie!!{x

If you need help heres some tips:
For the {GNewbie{x help channel. type '{Gnewbie <message>{x' and someone will help you.
If you need a god either type '{MPray{x' by its self, or with a message and a God if online will be notified.
 
If you have just died and are not familiar enough with the lands
enough to equip yourself then you may use the {ROUTFIT{x command.

Some tips: For starters, check out the newbie maps for some directions to
places you can handle. Leveling to 5 in the mud school is HIGHLY recommended,
but after that, you will have to find things to kill elsewhere. At level 6,
some good places are the bad neighborhood, and the gnome and smurf villages.
 
Also, once you're out of the school, you're going to have to find your
guildmaster to practice your skills as you advance. Directions to your
guildmaster can be found in the HELP GUILDMASTER file.
 
Also. As you progress, and begin asking Questus for quests, you'll quickly
find that {WTHE MAP SHOP IS YOUR FRIEND!!{z :-) It is located 3s, w, n from
the market square of Midgaard (also popularly abbreviated as MSM). 
 
Remember, don't be afraid to ask questions on the {Mnewbie{z channel, but try
to check and see if a help file covers it first.
 
And one last thing. When you finally reach {Clevel 10{z, you will see a {r[{z{RPK{z{r]{z flag
next to your name on the who list. {GTHIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU'VE KILLED ANYONE!{z
All it means is that you're no longer a newbie, and that players within your PK
range can attack you. Please see {YHELP PK{z for more. Good luck!
~
-1 0 'ASSASSINATE'~
Syntax: assassinate <victim>

The mark of a true ninja, a true master of his craft, is his ability to
sneak up on a victim, and kill them before he is detected.  Stepping out of
the shadows, he quickly approaches his target from behind and grasps their
head, twisting it suddenly and violently...  
 
                              {RC{x
                             {RR{x

to switch from the opponent that he is currently fighting to a different one
with remarkable quickness.  A shuffle of the feet, a cunning feint, and a
sidestep later, the samurai places himself in front of a different opponent.

~
-1 0 'SECOND WEAPON'~

skill, as it requires great discipline in practicing and using.  If you are

flames leap through the area, a samurai may also burn himself.

1 0 ROLE-PLAYING ROLEPLAYING~
Welcome to the world of D&D FR's.  If you are an experienced mudder you
should be right at home here.  If you don't think you are experienced,
please stay and try us out. We encourage roleplay here.
If you want hack-n-slash with no thought, paper thin characters, and other
characteristics of a boring mud, you are encouraged to play elsewhere as
that will be easier for you and for us.  To help you play a role, we have
cabals you can join for protection and power.  We want unique personalities,
as they make the game more fun for you and everyone else.  Good role-playing
is rewarded here so there is an incentive to get you going.  Don't just be a
giant warrior....  Be Gnarl, the One-Eyed Giant who happens to hate dwarves
and gnomes, for example.  It makes for a better atmosphere and a better
playing environment.  Please see an Immortal if there are any questions. 
Roleplaying means to create and act as another character.  Much like in
acting you develop another persona and move them about this make believe
world.  As a character, you should constantly be in that character's mind
and say and act as that character would.  Though you can adopt
chracteristics from yourself, the fun in playing a character is acting like
someone else.  This character is not you, so should not say things you know
about but that they couldn't, like the existence of airplanes or who one of
your other characters might know but the one you're currently playing
doesn't.  This basically means: keep each characters' knowledge separate. 
Each character has their own memories and thoughts.  There is never a reason
to say things that your character, as a real person, would not understand. 
This is called speaking out of character (OOC).  Do you sit around and talk
about how many hitpoints your dog or friend has?  Neither would your
character.  This is a game, and a great deal of the enjoyment comes from
playing.  Most of this playing should involve your role.  It is up to you to
create this role, you can be as simple or as wild and creative as you like,
the further you take it the better.  Once you've created a basic character
idea start thinking of ways you can play it out.  Does your character have
any personality quirks?  Maybe they're afraid of sharp objects so they never
use swords.  What about speech characteristics or mannerisms?  These are up
to you, and we expect you to create them.  A strong emphasis will be placed
on roleplaying and anyone who expects to be in any worthy positions should
have a strong character.  If you are having trouble creating a character go
through the character creation helps, which lists questions that you should
answer and can apply to a roleplaying environment.

-1 0 PLAYERKILL PLAYERKILLING PK PKING~
Player killing on Dungeons and Dragons is totally permitted.  In fact, it is

Expect to be PK'ed, and don't take it too personally. Remember, there's
safety in numbers. 

Remember to roleplay, not just kill anyone.

Do not drop link to avoid getting pked.  This is a sure-fire way to get
yourself killed, not by the attacker but by the immortals.

~
-1 0 ALIGNMENT~
In the interest of attracting the right caliber of followers, the
immortals of Muddy have outlined the following alignments.  See where you
think you fit in.  
 
{RLawful Good:   {WAn orderly, strong society with a well-organized government
can make life better for the majority of the people.  To ensure
the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed.  When
people respect the laws, and try to help each other, society as
whole prospers. 
 
{RLawful Neutral:  {WAlso believes in a strong, well-organized government, whether
it is a tyranny or democracy.  Organization and regimentation
bring benefits that outweigh any moral questions raised by
their actions.

{RLawful Evil:   {WThe use of society and its laws for personal benefit.  Structure
and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as
provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant.
Laws and societies are supported so long as they fit with
personal concerns.  Laws are obeyed out of fear of punishment.

{RNeutral Good:  {WA balance of forces is important, but the concerns of laws and
chaos do not moderate the need for good.  The universe is vast
and contains many creatures striving for different goals, so a
pursuit of good will not upset the balance.  Fostering good may
mean supporting an organized society, or overthrowing the
existing social order.  Social structure has no innate value.

{RTrue Neutral:  {WAlmost impossible to find such people as the majority of people
make judgments.  It is their duty to see that all of the forces;(evil, good, law, and chaos) remain in balance.  Alliances with
such people are odd, as they tend to switch sides as one side
brings the other to the point of destruction.

{RNeutral Evil:  {WThe primary concern for such people is their own advancement.
Working with others or on their own, their only interest is
getting ahead.  Such people are known for their 'Me, Myself,
and I' personalities.  No scruples, no conscience.

{RChaotic Good:  {WStrong individualists marked with a streak of kindness and
benevolence.  Goodness and right matter, but there is little
use for laws and regulations.  Their actions are morally good
but may not be in perfect agreement with the rest of society.

{RChaotic Neutral:  {WThere is no order to anything, even their own actions.
Good and Evil are irrelevant when making a decision.  They
are almost totally unreliable, except for the fact that you
can rely on them being like this.  The true coin-flipper, they
rely on fate and chance to lead them.

{RChaotic Evil:  {WThe bane of all that is good and organized.  Laws and
governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for
themselves.  The strong have a right to what they want, and
weak are there to be exploited.  Leadership among CEs is based
on power, with the leader capable of bullying his underlings
into obedience.

Each god may accept a follower based on these outlines{x
~
0 0 FOLLOW GROUP NOFOLLOW NOFOL~
Syntax: follow <character>
	group
	group <character>
	nofol 

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within 8 levels of
your own. Groups of 2 and 3 get experience bonuses.  See "help experience".

NOFOL is a toggle which makes you no longer accept followers.  This also
causes all people and mobs from following you at that time including who
you are following.  Type NOFOL again to reset the toggle back to accepting
followers.  No one can follow you when this toggle is set.

    period.  You are NOT allowed to multiplay in any way/shape/form. This

    something, comply with their request immediately without demanding to know

    stating the situation, time, date and the Immortal involved. If possible,

~
1 0 'LAW' 'LAWS'~
{CAll formal Laws extend from one simple foundation.  Each person has the
right to live their life and go about their business as they see fit, as
long as you do not infringe on that same equal right of others.
  
{R*************************************************************************
**  {WThe areas that are defined as protected by the jurisdiction of     {R**
**  {Wthe Law are the entirety of Midgaard, New Thalos, Caerlon, and the {R**
**  {WValley of Titans. All recognisable individuals and inhabitants of  {R**
**  {Wthe city are protected by the law.                                 {R**
*************************************************************************
{x
{W1.  {wMurder, Theft or fraud in any protected area is against the law.
    Theft includes taking taking items from a protected person's corpse,
    disarmed items, or their items appearing in any donation pit. The 
    stealing of services is considered theft.  Attempted murder and 
    theft are similarly against the law.
   
{W2.  {wAny act which could or does provoke a fight, or inhibits the free 
    will of a protected being, in a protected area is illegal.
    This includes offensive magic, special abilities, or triggering
    any non magical offensive abilities.
   
{W3.  {wAny act that removes a protected individual from a protected area
    without his consent is against the law. This includes, but is not
    limited to summon, recall, teleport, colour spray, and others. 
    Similarly summoning any aggressive mobile into a protected area is
    against the law.
  
{W4.  {wAny act that could or would prevent someone from witnessing or 
    reporting some other crime is against the law. This includes, but 
    is not limited to blindness, blackjack, and vampires touch.
   
{W5.{x  Fighting protected persons within the city limits is not permitted.
    If you are able to abandon combat you must.  Any commands from a 
    Ruler to this end must be heeded.  If you are unable to flee and slay 
    your attacker, the Law will not look down upon this unfortunate incident.
    All other fighting is strongly discouraged and if you are responsible
    for the death of a protected person then you will be held accountable.
   
{W6.  {wThe Law's jurisdiction extends to the enforcers themselves while
    they are pursuing their duties. This includes conducting 
    investigations in any protected area, or while in transit to a 
    protected area to pursue an investigation.  Any attempt to interfere 
    with an investigation is against the law.

{W7.  {wAny intrusion into the Ruler clan hall is considered an attack
    against the Law itself, and therefore against the law.  The 
    exception to this is to retrieve ones clan item.  If the attacker 
    removes anything from the clan hall other than their item then 
    they forego this exemption.  Any member of a clan that holds the 
    Ruler clan item has no rights under the law.
   
{W8.  {wAiding and abetting any known or wanted criminal is against the
    law. This includes but is not limited to assisting them in combat,
    healing them, giving them equipment, concealing knowledge or 
    evidence of a crime. This includes being in the same group --you 
    are liable for actions taken by your group mates, pets, and 
    followers.
   
{W9.  {wIt is permissible to help a victim to survive an attack through
    healing and beneficial spells. Rescuing is permitted only until 
    the victim has a chance to escape, at which point the rescuer must
    make every effort to break combat. Anyone who kills an attacker 
    must be ready to answer for it.

{W10. {wThese laws are to be enforced by the Rulers and guards only, 
    unless others are specifically deputized to assist. Vigilantism 
    within protected areas is illegal outside it is different thing.
   
{W11. {wThe summoning of aggressive creatures with lesser souls into a
    protected area is completely forbidden.  You are responsible for 
    the actions of any summoned or charmed creatures within a 
    protected area.
   
  {R** {CRulers may temporarily set aside the above laws at their 
  {R** {Cdiscretion, insofar as they are prosecuting a crime or recovering
  {R** {Citems stolen in a protected area.{x
 
{DOOC: If you have a problem with a Ruler, an interpretation of the Law
or a Ruler's mistake, you may appeal things to the {wLeader{D of Ruler. Do
NOT address complaints like these to the immortal.  Mistakes can and do
get made by the Rulers.  That is fine, and for the Leader to deal with.
The Immortals only get involved when there is clear abuse involved.{x

Syntax: blackjack <target>

Using a small leather sack filled with sand or lead, the thief delivers a
blow to the back of the victim's head, rendering them unconscious.  But as

Good characters may use this command to request items in the inventory or

0 0 PHILOSOPHY ~
Here is a general philosophy of each of the known clans.

Ruler:  The enforcement of the laws above all.  The world exists in two
	halves: right and wrong.  The law comes first in all respects.
	They control and decide what is lawful or not.  Their word is law.

BattleRager:  BattleRagers live for combat, and look down on those who need    
	      magic to survive.  They have a strong aversion to mage magic,
	      and are very wary of clerical magic.

Chaos:    Chaos wants to spread chaos throughout the land.  Not necessarily
	  evil, just against the orderwed society.  They feel that laws and
	  rules hamper freedom, and will go out of their way to see them
	  broken, or to cause chaos.

Knight:   Honor is valued above all else.  These fighting warriors seek to
	  right injustices and correct wrongs.  They follow the ideals of
	  the paladin. 

Shalafi:  In Dark-Elf language, it means 'Master'. Discipline brings power.
          This is the motto of the Masters of Arcane Arts. The advancement 
          of the Art is their motivation.  They look down on physical combat, 
          preferring to use their magic.

 
Invader:  Invader is born to invade or massacre.  Establishment of its power
     over all is its goal.  Invader, in short, wants to control the
     whole world, but would never do so openly.
 
Hunter:  Mercenaries of Icey.  These pupils kill any mobile or player
     with the money that they desire.  You may hire any of hunter
     for the above purpose.
 
Keep in mind these are only general guidelines for each of the clans.

	50:    10d169+920   930(923)  2610(2610)  1770(1767)

Diff = max - min.  Mean is the arithmetic mean.
The values in parenthesis are the the standard merc values.
~
0 0 MANADICE~
A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles mana.
The values the server generates for merc-type mobs is

  <level> d 10 + 100

where level is the level of the mobile.
~
92 0 DAMDICE~
A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles hitpoints.
Suggested values are:

       Level      dice       min      min    mean
        1         1d2+0       1        2       2
        2         1d2+1       2        3       3

       30         5d6+15     20       45      33
       50         5d10+25    30       75      53

Mean is the arithmetic mean.  The values in parenthesis are the the
standard merc values.  (Will be put in when there's time to calculate
them...)
~
0 0 RESETS~
Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.  
 
If you are reseting more than one thing in the room then use numbers in succession.
Such as reset 1, reset 2, reset 3, and so on and so forth.
~

    80        -400     -400     -400    -150

These values are 10 times what you would put in an area file. This
is because the server multiplies what it reads from file with 10.

OLC (On-Line Creation) allows to create/edit misc objects on-line.
There is quite a few OLC commands:
{Ccreate{x - used for creating different objects
{Cedit{x   - edit objects
{Calist{x  - list objects
{Casave{x  - save objects
{Cashow{x  - show objects
{Cresets{x - setting mob/obj resets
 
create/edit commands put you into OLC editor. To see available
commands within editor use '{Ccommands{x'. Use '{Cdone{x' to exit
from OLC editor.

92 0 'OLC ADDAFFECT'~
Syntax: addaffect <location | none> <modifier> [<bitloc> <bits...>]
 
 
Syntax: add ? will bring up a list of affects you can add
 
You can also add immunities and resistances to an object by adding in the imm or res bitflag
 
 
ex: addaffect hp 150 imm cold
 
ex: addaffect hp 150 res fire
 
~
0 0 TWIT~
Syntax: twit [name...]
 
Use 'twit' command to toggle names of chars in your twitlist. You won't hear
says, tells, socials, gossips etc. from chars listed in your twitlist.
 
~
1 0 SHOOT~
You can use this command only when you have the bow skill. To shoot,
you must wield a bow and hold an arrow in your hand.
 
The syntax is: {Wshoot direction mob-name{x, a.e. {Wshoot south fido{x.
 
The range is equal to your scan range (check it with {Wscan [direction]{x
command). You can choose the target you want to shoot at with standard
[num.] prefix.
 
If you are wearing a quiver containing arrows, you will not need to hold
them in your hand to shoot, and you will instead draw them directly
from the quiver, provided that you have a free off-hand to draw them with.

{CWarlock, Arcanists of the Five Magics{x
{C====================================={x

Warlocks covet knowledge, information, and ultimately power.  Unless
there is something to gain, they generally spare little time for the
ineptitude of others.  Affronted by the concept that their magic aptitude is
anything but the result of each individual's hard labor of studies, they
oftentimes ignore the ignorant.  In addition to the disdain the members of
Warlock harbor for those unable to unlock their arcanic potential, the
members of Warlock hold those who rely on otherworldly figures for power in
special contempt, save for the clerical members of Warlock who serve as a
link to the extradimensional planes that house the deities, to one day
usurp those powers, or at the very least, sever the link between the two
planes.

{WClasses: ANY except Paladin
{c^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^{W
{WAlignment/Ethos: Any Evil
{c^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
{DScion is a clan whose overriding purpose is to seek the pathways
to power and wealth, through whatever means.  Each member, while 
valued for their individualistic nature, finds their own way to 
contribute to the furthering of that overall goal.  At times, 
personal objectives can lead to conflict within, but typically 
those disputes are resolved quickly and often fatally to the 
losers misfortune.

The traits that best define a Scion are those of deceit, subtlety, 
resourcefulness, and when necessary lethalness.  A Scion's first 
instinct typically lies in the almost obsessive pursuit of an 
objective.  They will do what they can to not only influence 
events to their own benefit, but also to the detriment of any that
they deem a liability.  Which, on occasion, does not exclude a 
friend or former ally.  

In days past, entrance to the halls of Scion was loosely
controlled and members almost always faded into obscurity.
Rarely lending their talents to the overall victory of 
the clan.  Now, the clan seeks to bolster its ranks with 
those trulydedicated to not only themselves, but also to
the common pursuit that each shares. As such, subtlety 
is a virtue that cannot be underestimated.  Overt requests 
are rarely viewed as signs of quality, but can, if presented
persuasively, bring about a positive reaction.  Otherwise,
demonstrating those very qualities that Scions value 
highly will facilitate entrance.  

It is expected of any applicant to not only understand the
tenets of the clan they wish to join, but also to provide
insight into what unique value they bring to the clan. That 
value is a tool which others should be able to use to further 
their own paths.  Failure to adhere to this edict results in 
severe action and if such tendencies are noted in applicants, 
will often be cause for dismissal of any potential admission.{W
 
 
You must become one of the scions to understand their powers.{x
~
-1 0 DEMAND~
Syntax: demand <itemname> <mob>

The most cruel adventurers of these realms, anti-paladins, can threaten
mobs and force them to give an item away.  The higher your charisma, the
better the chance of success.  Of course, you can't retrieve cursed items
this way, and if the monster considers you too pathetic, it'll simply attack
and try to kill YOU.  There is a timer on this command so that you can't
just walk around and collect free gear from mobs.  
~

D&D is home to {C3{x clans at the moment, with 2 more awaiting opening
when a worthy leader is found.  You must be level {C20{x to join a clan,
and have written a description.  You must also meet the clan's alignment
requirements.  Each player may only join {YONE CLAN{x, no matter how many
alts (alternate characters) they have.  Any player who is caught being
a member of more than one clan will have all clanned characters {rdeleted{x.
There will be no exceptions.  There is no reason to violate this rule.
 
Characters in clans are expected to roleplay the mission of their clan.
Enforcing this will first be left to the Leader of the clan, and if
necessary, the Immortals will intervene.
 
To find out about each clan, check out their helpfiles.  No helpfiles
are listed for clan skills/spells, as these are secret in nature.  Clan
members publically talking about these skills may find themselves 
ejected from the clan, or worse.

-1 0 WITCHES~
Witches are a class of powerful magicusers, the female counterpart to the
Warlock class.  They dedicate their entire lives to the mastery of the
arcane arts, caring little for the rigorous physical challenges of hand to
hand combat.  A witch studies and understands the complexities of the energy
binding together the universe, commanding its power at her fingertips.  It
is said that some witches have the ability to cast a curse on their victims
which leads to an unavoidable and excrutiatingly painful death.  
~
-1 0 'ARROWS' 'MAKE ARROWS' 'GREEN ARROW' 'RED ARROW' 'WHITE ARROW' 'BLUE ARROW'~
Syntax: make arrow   {Ror{x  make arrow <green/red/white/blue>

A ranger is capable of making wooden arrows while in the forest from the
materials that he finds.  The number of arrows he can make at once, and the
power of the arrow increases as the ranger himself grows in skill and power.

Once he has mastered the technique of crafting ordinary wooden arrows, he
can learn to create special arrows that can poison, burn, shock, and freeze.

Veteran warriors are the only ones capable of training fourth, and fifth
attacks.  These highly advanced fighting techniques require much dedication
and training to master.  A warrior is never guaranteed to land all five
attacks every round, no matter how skilled he has become in both fourth and
fifth attacks.  However, the chance that they will land increases greatly as
the skills nears perfection.  
~
-1 0 'SECONDARY ATTACK'~
Secondary attack allows the wielder of two weapons to attack a second
time with his second weapon.  This skill is automatic once practiced, but
works only if a second weapon is used.

Syntax: detect sneak
Syntax: detect hide

The sharp eyes of a thief are able to discern subtle differences in
shading and lighting.  With use of detect hide, he is able to observe
creatures and players who are trying to hide in the shadows.  
 
'Detect Sneak' is a synonym for detect hide.
~
-1 0 'PUSH'~

A sly thief can skillfully steer a victim in a direction that leads them
out of the room they are in.  If this skill fails, the target will attack.

-1 0 'BUTCHER'~
Syntax: butcher corpse

To survive in the wilderness, one must be willing to eat most any food
they come across.  Rangers make use of the fallen corpses of their enemies
to carve steaks from for future consumption.  The meat is unseasoned, and
will begin to rot after a short while, making it unfit to eat.  
~
-1 0 'AMBUSH'~
Syntax: ambush <victim>

From his camouflage in the forest, a ranger is able to ambush
unsuspecting victims.  Only unwary victims are able to be attacked in this
fashion, those who can already see the ranger will simply avoid him. 

 
Also see help: 'ACUTE VISION'  {Rand{x  'CAMOUFLAGE'

-1 0 'ACUTE VISION'~
Syntax: cast 'acute vision'

Acute vision sharpens the vision of a ranger, allowing him to see any
camouflaged rangers.  This spell is the only means of detecting those who
are camouflaged, and is only castable on one's self.

-1 0 'RANGER STAFF'~
Syntax: cast 'ranger staff'

A ranger is able to create a magical wooden staff with which to battle
his foes.  The weapon created will allow itself to be wielded only by
rangers, and once the spell expires, the staff crumbles to dust.  The power
of the staff increases with the level of the ranger.  
~
-1 0 'LIGHTNING BOLT'~
Enki's preferred method of dealing death to the enemies of his followers.
~
-1 0 'DISHONOR'~
Syntax: dishonor

Once a samurai has passed level 10, he can not flee a battle unless his
opponent is much stronger than him.  It is wise to note that samurai will
delete themselves when they have died 11 times.  The death counter is
displayed on your score scroll.  The death counter can be lowered for 300
questpoints per death.  
 
When the samurai retreats from a battle where the odds overwhelm him and
his group he will not suffer dishonor.  But when the odds do not justify
a retreat, and the samurai is acting cowardly instead of facing death
without fear, then the samurai will suffer 'dishonor'.  This social
stigma is so binding that a samurai can only save himself from disgrace
by defeating a stronger opponent in solo battle.
 
Until the time the samurai's honor is restored he will not be able to
gain experience from battle, nor refine his stills.  Questors of the
realm will also shun the samurai, and no one will group with him either.
 
Fleeing like a coward from death at the hand of a peer will permenently
reduce a samurai's social standing (Charisma).  Gaining a reputation for
doing so, will have terrible concequences on the respect they command.
Regaining one's honor, will occationally restore social standing, but
a habit of dishonor will ultimately cast the samurai into disgrace.
Fleeing from an equal soul (PK) will almost always cause one to lose face.

As the code of ancient Bushido says, '{rDeath before dishonor{x'.

0 0 CLAN 'HOW TO JOIN A CLAN'~
To be able to join a clan you must first make sure you have completed
these things:

{W1.{R){x The first thing you must make sure you have done is to have a
          description of what your character looks like. Now I know that 
          some of you think some descriptions written a certain way look
          cool but most of them are not actually descriptions at all. First
          lets look at the word "DESCRIPTION" what does it mean? 
          What is it's meaning? Here I will clear that up for you right now.

{WDescription: {BA representation in words of the nature and characteristics of a
                  thing, person, animal, place, boundry that you are describing.{x

What this means is that you are putting a picture of these things into words.
You must write it out so that the person who reads it can actually picture
the thing, person, animal, place, boundry being described.

The crucial things you must remember to describe are specified below:
A: Height
B: Body Markings
C: Hair Color, Length, Style, Upkeeping (if any)
D: Eye Color, what they hold when looking into them. Do they glow, burn, etc.
E: Facial Features, Ears, Chin, Jaw line, Cheek bones, Nose, Neck, etc.
F: Color/Texture of skin.
G: Posture and how you hold/carry yourself.
H: Basic Clothing such as cloaks, shirts, pants, boots, gloves, hat, jewelry, etc.

{W2.{R){x You must obtain your {W20th{x level in your guild before you may
          consider joining any clan. Once you have joined a clan you may 
          not switch becuase you don't like them or they are losing in a war
          with another clan. Once you have joined a clan you are required to
          {YROLEPLAY{x at all times, unless you are speaking on the OOC
          channel you are required to {YRP{x at all times.

{W3.{R){x Understanding the {RRULES OF THE GAME{x: HELP RULES.

{W4.{R){x Read the help file and any other related helpfiles about your clan
          and {YROLEPLAY{x as one that would want to be in that clan.

--->> Talk to a member of that clan and get their acceptance and recommendation
      into that clan before you petition or attempt to speak with the Leader.
        A) Have them write a letter to the clan and imms stating that they are either
           recommending you or if they are rejecting you as a prospect member.

--->> Now write a note to the clan and imms stating why you want to join and why
      they should allow you to join. Put in the note who your god/goddess is,
      your path in life, a little about your past and what your full name is: (first and
      Last). This note and all notes sent to the clan must be in a {WPURE{x {Y
      RP{x format or else they will be deleted and you will have to write it again.

--->> You must find your way to the clan hall on your own. You may ask for hints
      but do not ask where the exact location of the clan is. If you are found out
      to have been asking such things your petition will be rejected for 7 days 
      real time.
         A) Good exampes of hints to ask for are:
            What general area is it in?
            Is it North from such-n-such city or which direction?
            What are some land marks I should watch for?

         B) Bad examples of hints to ask for are:
            Can you give me the directions to such-n-such clan hall?

--->> Next send a petition to the clan you wish to join by doing the following:
      {CSyntax:{x {Wpetition <<clan name>> <<your name>>{x

--->>Talk to the clan leader or the second telling them why you want to join
     and try to be as specific as possible.

--->> Fullfill the quest/requirements set aside by the clan leader/second.

-1 0 PERSONAL DESCRIPTIONS~
{Y======================{x
{RDescription Guidelines{x
{Y======================{x
 
{C1: Must have a description in between levels 15 and 20.{x
 
Why? Because it will keep you out of the description room and away from the immortals assigned to make sure of this. Another reason is that it is good form, as well as good RP and will get you more friends in the long run. Dungeons and Dragons denizens enjoy to role play and they'll role play with anyone who seems up to snuff.
 
 
{C2: After formation, your description should be no less than 5 lines.{x
 
Why? Five lines of a descriptive text will allow anyone enough room to properly identify everything about their character that they want other's to see. {RPlease try not to place personal items of clothing in your description. If you feel you must do it, please have a valid reason as to why you've written it in there. Using anything similar to, "Well, I wear clothes under armour because it's just how it was done back then." Won't really cut it. Clothing can be included in a description, but it needs to be simple things, nothing that would completely contradict the armour you are wearing.....{x
 
{C3: Before Creation, Try to come up with some sort of flavor to your character.{x
 
Why? Not only will you be able to quickly apply your description to your character, it will also give you an idea of what you need to role play with. Is your guy or gal a big person, physically strong, and mentally weak. Or is your guy or gal physically ok, and mentally excellent. Keep in mind, these key factors all determine how you role play your character. It wouldn't do any good to play out a mega-super strong warlock character whose as dumb as a pile of rocks. 
 
Playing that would mean that your warlock would never be able to cast a spell, and would be a better warrior than anything. Just as well, choose race and class carefully. Please don't be an Anti-Paladin troll running around with a tattoo of Eros. Itjust doesn't fit and takes away quite a bit from the purpose of religion. Though, should it be found that there's an unimaginable amount of logic behind the decision, I do not see why the tattoo cannot stay.
 
{C4: Have something incredibly unique.{x
 
The one thing that we must all remember is that not every good aligned character should dress is all white and have a golden aura/halo wrapped around them at all times. And another thing we'll all need to keep in mind that not all evil aligned characters have horns and wings. Some of the best role players I've ever seen as an evil character have dressed in colours other than black. They've done it well, and are still commended for it. Be creative. AND unique in every aspect.
 
 Instead of having a Necromantic Dark-Elf dress is robes of black silk, with an ashen white face, taught to the touch and rough to the eye. Try to have him or her become a hauntingly beautiful Dark-Elf Necromancer who dresses in slightly vibrant colours. In this game, everything anyone ever wanted to be can be done. Deceive others and make sure that they don't know which way you flop on the three pole picket fence. What's the best way to deceive my enemies and then spring a trap on them. Become creative! It'll be well worth it in the long run.
 
{C5: If you are in a clan YOU HAVE NO CHOICE! YOU MUST ROLE PLAY OR BE EXPELLED FROM THAT CLAN! THIS DOES INCLUDE MAKING SURE YOUR DESCRIPTION FITS PROPERLY!{x
 
Why: Because it's the rules.

Notes:
 
Use a max of 1 hit/damroll/-saves/attrib points per 10 levels for normal armor.
Use a max of 1 hit/damroll/-saves/attrib points per 5 levels for limited armor.
Use a maximum of -1ac per 5 levels for normal, -1ac per 3 levels for limiteds.
E.G. a level 20 helm could have a very maximum of +1 int/ +1 wis, or a
{x   level 50 limited belt could have a maximum of 10 damroll.
A note on weapons.  For normal weapons, do NOT modify the average, allow
{x   autoweapon to determine the average.  For limiteds, the average may
{x     be raised a max of 25% above that set by autoweapon.  Ask me how to
{x       determine this if you do not know, and I will explain it to you.
 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
Allow 3 build points per level for normal gear.
Allow 5 build points per level for limited gear.

   50(level)*5 build points = 250 build points
     +3 con = 15 build points
     +5 str = 25 build points
     +5 hitroll = 50 build points
     +5 damroll = 50 build points

0 0 'LEAVING A CLAN AND JOINING A SECOND CLAN'~
It seems that there have been a lot of misconceptions about the rules
about leaving a clan and joining a new one.  For a while, the primary rule
of thumb has been "No, no, no."  However, in practice, a lot of situations
have come up where it made sense for exceptions to be made, and the lines
have been blurred.

In truth, there are situations where it is acceptable for a player to leave
a clan and join another.  Those situations are:
 

1) The clan changes. Example: Analar, an anti-paladin in Shadow, left their
ranks after their doctrine changed to exclude magic users.

2) The clan leader rejects and kicks out a member for one reason or another.
Example: A new leader takes over for a clan, and decides to "clean house," and
remove members he doesn't like or ones who don't support his rule. (Other
clans should think long and hard about accepting someone who's been rejected
from another clan, though.)

3) The player didn't meet the guidelines for the clan when he was accepted.
Example: Someone who was not chaotic found himself in clan Chaos. His
membership is essentially invalid; a mistake. (And whoever let him in will
probably find themselves in some amount of trouble for not being more
thorough and careful.)

In all of the above situations (the first two more than the last), there must
be some sort of PUBLIC ROLEPLAY on the part of both the player leaving the clan
and the clan's leader, and if/when the player finds himself wanting to join
a second clan, there must be EXPLICIT IMMORTAL APPROVAL for their admittance.


If anyone has any questions about this, please feel free to ask.

New House Rules

   The base cost for a house is 20k qps and 1mil gold in the bank. [1][2]

   Alternative ways to pay for those who don't like to quest: 

      o RolePlay medals issued by an IMM may be traded in at an exchange
        rate of 1 per 500 qps for a max of 5k qps.

      o Roleplay awards recommended by the RolePlay Council(RPC) in
        recognition of a month's worth of good roleplay may be exchanged
        at the following rate: 5pts per 1k qps (max 15k qps).
{x                    {D(See HELP {cRPC AWARDS{D){x

      o Campaign medals for defense or attack on a town (IMM run quest)
        can be exchanged at 10 per 3k qps, or a max of 3k qps.

   This gets you 10 rooms. 1 guard, 4 mobs, 5 furniture, 3 wearables.

   You must purchase a base-house at minimum.  No smaller houses are
   offered.  If you do not wish to use all of it, that is fine.  All
   other upgrades to your house must be purchased at costs listed below.

   Aside from having the base cost in hand, the following requirements
   must also be met before building on your house commences.
      o You must be Hero level
      o You must petition a builder to agree to build your house
      o You must complete a quest(s) assigned by that builder
      o You must have the complete plans of your base house submitted
      and approved by the builder and the head builder.

   [1] locating it outside your hometown increases the base price
   by 10 to 20% depending on the location.  The more inaccessible
   the higher the cost of getting a build permit for the location.
   The exact percentage will be determined by the Head Builder or DMs.

   [2] serving a public good (allowing no less than 75% of your house
   to be used by approximately 1/3 of the realm's population) will lower
   the base cost of your house by up to 20%.  The percentage will be
   determined by the Head Builder or DMs, and will depend on how much
   the theme of the house adds to the mud.  Please note, that if you
   post an external guard, it must follow the normal mob rules.  The
   free 'guard' mob can be used for your personal sanctuary.

1 0 THORNAN BATTLE HUNTING WAR WARRIOR RANGER~
The Lord of Battle is as chaotic in nature as war itself.  He favors a
side almost randomly, smiling on the defender one moment, then the attackers
the next.  This only tends to add to the ebbs and flow of the battle, the
very thing that Thornan loves.  By his very nature however, he is neutral as
to the battle's outcome and so rarely will he act decisively for one side of
the other, rather he may be on one side one day, then against them the next.
For all of this, Thornan is still a warrior and hunter and he will often
smile on great feats of bravery in battle, although of course he might
reward them with a glorious death just as easily as victory.  He hates
cowardice and will vent his displeasure on any that show it during a battle.
Just as Thunder and Lightning over the seas are said to be the anger of the
tempest, when it is seen in the mountains it is said that Thornan is hunting
and that the rumbles are his war chariot, the flashes, the light from his
Axe and Hammer.  Few but the bravest souls will venture from the valley
during such times.  When the night skies are clear and a streak of light is
seen racing cross it, it is said that Thornan hunts the stars themselves,
and that the sparks of light are his arrows.  Thornan is also the hunter's
guide, and Lord of the animals.  Few hunters will take an animal without
giving thanks to Thornan for the bounty and gift he has granted them.  Just
as in battle, he is chaotic in his giving, sometimes on the hunter's side,
and sometimes the prey.  This keeps the balance between the natural life and
those that need to use it to survive.  Thornan makes his home in the forests
and the mountains of Thera.  As the Lord of Battle, Thornan oversees all
battles, be they great or small.  He blesses bravery and shows his
displeasure on cowardice.  He is also the god of hunting and animals,
watching over both and ensuring that there will always be enough prey for
the hunters.  Thornan's symbol is a shield with a hammer or axe embossed
onto it.  This can be any size and so can be worn as a pendant, or as a real
shield.  His color is a blood red, the same as that spilled by warriors and
animals.  His sacared animal is the Lion and his drink is the Ale that is
loved by dwarven warriors.  While Thornan's priests are busiest when there
is a battle coming, they are active at all times of the years.  They have a
number of duties, from blessing hunters and leading celebrations of thanks
for a successful hunt, to joining the front ranks of the army when war is on
the way.  Even during times of peace, the priests of Thornan are easy to
spot.  They either wear blood red armor, which they keep well maintained, or
blood red robes and a steel skullcap.  Most of Thornan's followers are
warriors and hunters, sometimes both, such as the scouts and rangers who
wander the hills and valley.  Though monetary offerings are very much
acceptable by the temples, many given their offerings in way of meat taken
on a hunt or weapons and armor that they have crafted.  During war times,
the numbers of people who come to the temple increase vastly as they pray to
Thornan to smile on loved ones involved in the fighting and for their side
to have a quick and decisive victory.  While Thornan is remembered on many
days of the year, playing an under card role on Zsuzsu's Day of Remembrance,
the first of the year and having prayers and feasts held by veterans on the
anniversaries of great battles, his main day is the last day of the year,
the claimed day of the finding of the valley and city.  On this day all
people remember the wars and battles of the past as well as those lives that
have been lost.  At dawn, soldiers, retired and active, march in full armor
through the city to the city center (market square), each company carrying a
reef of flowers to place on the memorial there.  Once the prayers and
speeches are done, there is a celebration, which is held to celebrate the
victories won and those comrades in arms who have passed on.  Unlike the Day
of Remembrance, Victory Day is held with reverence, but also celebration and
joy.

0 0 zar'za~
What is Zar'za many ask?  Well you have found the right place to find
out what it is.  Zar'za is an ancient Path of the great lords of power.  The
great lords ran the world as we new it at one time.  They were of every race
and alignment.  The belief system in which ones power lies in its energy
thee self and in their god.  This power was given to those who worshiped
their god and made it a life style to follow the rules and ways of their
gods.  So basically mortals were given godly power by the gods they followed
cause the mortals have gained much of there trust and believed that doing
this would help them shape the world to their will.  There was only one
problem in this system.  The problem was that no mater how hard one god and
or mortal seek to wield the world to their soul.  There was always anthers
(god or mortal) that was stronger and wiser and for told the problem and
tried balanced the world to a equal order.  But it then came to a time where
when the one god that started it also ended this system.  This immortal was
known by all and herd by all.  His name was Thorel.  He saw that there could
be no equality in this system for he saw visions of destruction to become
clear of this path.  This made him come to the conclusion that power in
anyway can not be given to mortals for mortals can not control these powers
no matter how hard he or she strived to try.  The mortals that were given it
only used it for destruction and power and nothing more.  So as Thorel had
seen this he had also destroyed it in a blink of an eye!  Then all mortals
lost their power.  From then on mortals and immortal alike only thought of
this to be a fairy tale and nothing more.  Could it be true or could it not.
Will we ever know?  There is only one that can remember the truth and the
lies and this persons name is ....

92 0 OLC AREA LIMIT RARE~
There may only be A MAXIMUM of 2 RARE TYPE OF ITEMS PER AREA. This means that
the item gets level x 5 number of build points like the old limiteds. You may
have 2 of them in your area and remember this is a MAXIMUM.  If the area the
item is in is between 20-30 you should be lvl 40-50 to get the item from
that area.  ALL RARE ITEMS must have a code written giveing it a chance
for that item to load on that mob's corpse when you kill it, AND you MUST put
the word 'RARE' in the NAME field of the object.

This is the process to add the MPCODE to the mob that will percent-load the
rare object:

edit (or create) mp <mpcode vnum>
code
mob oload <obj vnum>
~~
done
edit mob <mob vnum>
trigadd <mpcode vnum> death 20
done

Wand      Object's Level       1/2 Object's Level
Staff     1/2 Object's Level   1/4 Object's Level

20th level wands would have spells at spell level 20, and a max of 10 charges.
20th level staves would have spells at spell level 10, and a max of 5 charges.

want to place on it at or before the object's level. (No lvl 2 pills with
lvl 1 heal!!) If you aren't sure, CHECK or ASK ANOTHER IMM!
 
Thank you!

1 0 DWARVEN CREATION~
The Creation of the Dwarves Recorded by Marak, Golden-Hammer, Son of
Jardak, Hammer of the Orcs.  In the age before the beginning of time there
were no dwarves, elves, or humans and the world was not yet made.  Only the
Eternal Forge existed, in the Home of the Maker, in the Caverns of the
Everlasting Flame.  Into the Eternal Forge the Maker placed stone and fire. 
As the fire heated the stone it expanded, and rivers of molten ore ran from
the interior of the stone, flowing along its sides.  With tongs and hammer
the Maker forged the world.  He struck and titanic mountains rose from the
surface again, and hills formed, leaving deep valleys and great hollows. 
When he was pleased with its shape and form, he quenched the world in the
Trough of Life.  As the water struck the surface, clouds of steam rose to
form the sky.  The waters of the Trough settled in valleys and flowed into
the hollows to become seas.  The Maker held up his work and saw that it was
fitting.  He set the world upon a great pinnacle of the finest mithril, and
there it remains until this day.  The Maker laughed and decided to test his
world.  He would make a race of miners and forgers and they would strive to
find the mithril pinnacle upon which the world rests, deep in its heart. 
And so the Maker returned to the Eternal Forge in the Caverns of the
Everlasting Flame.  Taking water from the Trough of Life and stone from the
earth he held them together.  When he was satisfied, he added molten iron to
strengthen it.  He gathered this fine alloy and shaped it on the Anvil of
Spirit.  To assist him, the Maker created the gods.  He beat them into their
shapes.  Like him, the gods were broad and stocky, with fine, long beards of
rusty-red iron or shimmering mithral.  Then he quenched them in the Trough
of Life so that they, like the world, could take part of its life-giving
waters.  One by one he lifted them up and blew on them.  Their eyes opened
and they lived.  The Maker had forged the gods from the elements of the
earth, but his work was not yet finished.  He took the Gods of Crafts and
taught them how to make things that would please him he taught the God of
Fire to burn and to fan the flames of life.  He taught the Gods of the
Elements the use of their powers.  He revealed to them all the place of the
gods in the world.  Then the Maker took rock and iron and heated them in the
Eternal Forge.  He forged the most pleasing shapes.  These he took and
quenched in the Trough of Life, and so the first dwarves were created.  Each
of the gods then took one of the dwarves and revealed to him the secrets
imparted by the Maker.  But to Frar, the Father of Dwarves, the first King,
the Maker himself spoke.  He told Frar of the mithril pinnacle and gave him
the gift of wisdom to rule his people.  And so the First Dwarves came into
the world in full knowledge of their arts and crafts.  Once the First
Dwarves had learned these things, the Maker placed them in a land he had
chosen for them on the earth, into the mines and caverns he had created for
their entertainment and their joy.  In these sacred caverns the First
Dwarves multiplied and prospered, but some became restless and went in
search of greater riches.  These were Glordin Anvil Forger, son of Bardin
Hammer Beater...  The original text continues with a catalog of genealogies.
As we resume the narrative, a thousand years have passed, and dwarfkind has
expanded through the valleys and mountains of the land.  After the First
Dwarves had been laid in their tombs, Blight came into the world.  The god
of Evil nursed a dark and ancient envy of the Makers creation of the
dwarves.  In cheerless caverns, which knew not the glow of dwarves hearts,
he labored to imitate the maker.  Goblins, hobgoblins, evil giants, and
other monsters he made, and dreamed that they would destroy the dwarves.  In
imitation of the Maker he labored, but he lacked the true water from the
Trough of Life to mix with the stone and to make clean clay.  And so they
were tainted with his impurities.  Not content to work his own will, his
twisted tongue sowed discontent among the gods.  A few began, like him, to
imitate the Maker.  So it was that elves, gnomes, halflings, and humans came
into the world.  But these races lacked the iron that had been forged into
every dwarfs soul, they were sickly and pale to behold.  To compensate for
their deficiencies, the god of Evil bestowed magic.  He had overlooked
dwarven resistance to his evil, so it was used by other races against
themselves.  Then did the god of Evil send his creatures against the
dwarves.  The monsters were driven back many times, yet they bred quickly
and returned again and again in ever increasing numbers.  Now at this time
the lesser races spread over the world above, and they learned of the wealth
of the dwarves.  And so, men and elves began to covet the dwarves jewels
and mineral wealth.  Some sought to trade, others lied and used treachery to
acquire dwarven treasures.  An alliance of men and elves formed against the
dwarves and they brought war to the mountain homes.  Thus were the great
gates of the dwarf kingdoms closed and the stone halls sealed from the evil
of those beneath the sun.  The lesser races, not content to leave the
dwarves in peace, began to dig into the earth, but knew naught of its ways. 
Their folly awakened the dragons.  The dragons rose in the fury of broken
sleep demanding tribute, but the lesser races could not satisfy their greed.
They appeased the dragons with tales of dwarven gold, and told them that the
mining of the dwarves had disturbed their slumber.  Those who had traded
with dwarves told what they had learned of the secrets of their realms.  And
so the dragons came to our ancestral halls and blew in the gates.  Spitting
fire, they slew many.  Those who survived fled their inheritance into the
world above.  Since that day new homes have been created and we give thanks
to the Maker for our increased wealth.  But prophecy says that one day the
caverns of the First Dwarves will be reclaimed.  Then will we be free from
the attacks of monsters and the ways of elves and humans.  I, Marak
Golden-Hammer, son of Jardak, Hammer of the Orcs, son of Makktat
Elf-Slayer...  The text again is given over to genealogies before ending
with Marak Golden-Hammers seal.

1 0 CREATION OF THE WORLD~
The Creation of the World!  Dwarves are a long-lived race, 350 years on
average, and so they are closer to the creation of the world than shorter
lived races, such as humans.  Dwarves have a clear idea of how they and the
world came into existence and this in turn affects how they see themselves,
the world, and other races.  Many are the myths of creation.  The Scrolls of
Narvil, much debated, describe creation as an accident.  After the Creator
had forged the world and made the dwarves, he became weary and slept.  Some
Lesser Gods, jealous of the Creators skill, bound him as he slept.  They
heated the Great Forge to make races in their own likenesses, men, and
elves.  These they placed upon the world.  But they fell to arguing among
themselves over which part of the world should be given to their peoples. 
The clamor of dispute woke the Creator who saw what they had done and became
angry.  But they laughed at him and bound him fast and swore he would never
be released.  They fueled the fire of the Eternal Forge and continued to
work.  However, they did not know how to control the Great Forge and it
became too hot.  Great globules of molten stone flew into the air and fell
to the earth.  As they fell, the Creator breathed on them to cool them so
that his people would not be injured.  The force of his breath gave life to
the molten fragments and these became dragons.  And so, of all the creatures
of the earth, only the dwarves and the dragons were made by the Creator. 
Dwarves by the skill of his hands, and dragons by the power of his breath. 
The idea of a forge to create the world and its people is a typical dwarven
myth.  Marak and Narvil share the myth, though they name it differently. 
Marak speaks of a Maker and Narvil of a Creator.  Dwarves in different parts
of the world will have contrasting views of the creation myth, in far
kingdoms even contradictory views.  Some might believe the world was an
accident, a piece of rock that was chipped away from a greater one by the
blow of a hammer or other force, and became separated from it, and developed
on its own.  The creation story is normally part of a greater cycle of
creation, in which the world is created only to be ravaged, but ultimately
saved, as Narvil foretold: The Creator tried to break his bonds, but they
were too secure.  He argued with the Lesser Gods but they would not listen. 
You cannot rule the world unless you can work the forge, he warned. 
Sometimes when the forge became too hot or too cold, he gave the Lesser Gods
advice, add more air, use less fuel.  They laughed at him for his
weakness in telling the secrets of the forge.  Again he warned: One day,
the forge will burn beyond your control and the world will be seared by the
heat of its flames.  Then you shall free me or all will perish, even we. 
Then will I bring justice to the world you have abused.  And my people shall
be saved from your waging of war.   Other myths exist.  Gully dwarf priests
believe the world was swallowed by a giant monster, digested, and later
reformed.  Many foretell the destruction of all within the world.  Some tell
of a world ravaged by dragons who burned away all life with their fiery
breaths.  Only the races living deep within the world survived.  Dwarves,
orcs, and goblins, protected in their subterranean homes, escaped the wrath
of the dragons.  Different mythical beliefs may cause friction between
dwarves and other races and even among the dwarves themselves.  Most
mountain dwarves shun humans and believe in the quest for mithral, the metal
of unconquerable weapons.  Irvak, a mountain dwarf teacher, tells children
why.  Beware the ways of man.  He is greedy and avaricious beyond
understanding.  He seeks to possess wealth and riches, but most of all power
over others.  It is our duty to resist the mad lust of humankind to dominate
other races.  Not all men are evil, but the worst are their leaders who lead
them into wars against us.  It is written that only through the power of
mithral can we protect our halls.  This mountain dwarf credo is rejected by
Yakir, a gully dwarf priest.  Learn to accept the ways of humans, we have no
other choice.  If a man kicks you, keep out of reach of his boot.  If he
spits at you, it will not break your bones.  We breed slowly and must
protect our numbers.  If we fight mankind, they will eventually kill us all.
Avoid wealth and riches, but if you must have treasure, hide it well in a
filthy place where none would guess to look.  Always avoid mithril and those
who bear it.  It is so precious that men are driven crazy with desire.  
~
1 0 WHAT IS THE WORLD~
What is the World?  To most dwarves the world is made up of the dark
places underground.  The lands above are strange and remote.  Almost
certainly they would have been formed or shaped by the gods of other lands. 
Most dwarves believe that the world is made up of a number of parts created
for different peoples.  Dwarves were given the deep earth as their own,
elves the forests, halflings the fields each in their own place.  Many
believe that the whole world was originally given to the dwarves.  Their
legends contain tales of how parts of the world were taken away by other
gods when they created the other races.  Few dwarves could have any real
knowledge of the shape of the surface of the world and their subterranean
lives have caused them to develop some very strange beliefs: worlds shaped
like a globe, an egg, a flattened disk, a jagged rock with a central
pinnacle and even a great depression in the earth, among them.  Many legends
are concerned with the depth of the earth.  Many deep dwarves believe that
it is possible to tunnel so far down that the diggers emerge through the
bottom of the world.  Their priests and sages argue incessantly as to what
lies at the bottom of the word.  Some claim that only empty space exists
beneath the world.  Most deep dwarf miners believe that the world rests on a
spike of gold that will one day make them rich beyond even dwarven dreams of
avarice.  Some duergar religions proclaim that the world rests on their
dwarvish equivalent of hell and, if they dug through to it, they would gain
the aid of the evil creatures who dwell there.  With the aid of these
allies, the duergar would destroy all who oppose them.  Some think the world
is a living organism or an intricate machine that needs careful maintenance
if it is to continue.  They believe each race was created to look after its
part of the world, the dwarves caring for the underground realms.  
~
1 0 WHAT ARE CELESTIAL LAMPS~
What are Celestial Lamps?  Dwarves may have been created underground, but
sooner or later they emerged into the world above.  At that point they
wondered about the lights moving in the sky, and what the sun was.  The
dwarves compared these celestial bodies to fire beetles or bright gems
rather than natural phenomena.  Narvils scrolls equate the sun with the
blazing flames shooting from the chimney of the Great Forge.  After their
arguments, the Lesser Gods grew weary and slept.  The Creator, bound and
tied, remained vigilant.  Through the night he watched the Great Forge
slowly cool.  When the flames were almost extinguished, and all was dark, he
blew on the embers to light the fire.  Red embers and fresh flames blew up
the chimney of the forge and created the First Dawn.  The heavens are
interpreted differently by Or-Kazil, the gem-master and mystic who caught
the light of the sun and placed it in the gems of Arbir.  On the stone of
his hall is an inscription.  The difficult text is a masterpiece of dwarven
poetry.  Fear is the sun.  The light.  Carried by the watchman in daily
traverse.  Great is the light of his torch.  It conceals his presence.  Fear
is the moon.  Its ghostly light.  Gray scarred surface, a spoiled gem. 
Bring me a jewel from the night sky.  One that twinkles in the watchmans
light as he walks behind the world.  Set it upon my tomb.  
~
1 0 THE DWARVEN GODS~
The Dwarven Gods In one creation myth the gods were made by the Maker
into shapes he found pleasing.  In other creation tales all gods descend
from a common ancestor, and have since multiplied.  Each god, at his birth,
chose his own form to be superior, then created a race in his own image. 
The gods mated with their creations to make other gods, which then took
their place in the pantheon.  Tales abound of racial heroes elevated to
godhood for great deeds or leading exemplary lives.  Ancestor worship
thrives among these heroes descendants.  
~
1 0 THE DWARVEN AFTERLIFE~
Dwarven AfterLife Like humans and other races, dwarves have their own
view of the afterlife.  The majority of dwarf warriors and priests expect to
journey to some great hall of heroes to wait for the day when they will be
called upon to fight their enemies once again.  Craft oriented dwarves look
forward to an afterlife of hard work and other pleasures.  The more
pessimistic religions even claim that no afterlife exists.  They do,
however, say that a dwarf can gain immortality by leaving stories of his
deeds, or by creating superior artifacts.  
~
1 0 DWARVEN ATTITUDES TOWARD OTHER RACES~
Attitudes Toward Other Races Dwarves are basically good people.  They
seek to harm no one, merely to coexist with them, or even better, to be left
alone.  Because of their good nature, dwarves have been known to persevere
in the face of insults and inexplicable behavior.  They have banded together
with men and elves in times of crisis, and have entered long term trade
agreements of mutual benefit.  They have little patience for the ways of
humans who simply do things wrong.  Humans either waste time in petty
pursuits or are so keen to achieve their goals, they are willing, almost
eager, to be forceful and rude.  They have no conception of the proper
rhythm of the world, which is hardly surprising since they allow their lives
to be dominated by the changes of night and day and the seasons.  No sooner
do they achieve something, than their children want to change it, replace
it, or worse, lose interest in it entirely.  Elves should know better, but
they lack the simplest virtues of patience, diligence, and consistency. 
They are renowned for wasting their lives enjoying themselves instead of
producing lasting goods.  The differences between elves and dwarves have led
to many disagreements.  This usually occurred because dwarves considered
agreements to be binding until the end of time, while the elves thought they
were to last as long as they were useful.  Entire strongholds may have been
threatened or destroyed because elves failed to honor a pledge.  Perhaps
some minor slight elves have forgotten, has been harbored and nurtured and
passed on to the next generation.  As fellow underground dwellers, gnomes
are looked upon more favorably by dwarves, though the gnomes delight in
black humor and practical jokes has caused friction.  
~
1 0 WAR TO THE DEATH~
War to the Death!  Dwarves do not compromise when dealing with evil
races, particularly when competing with them for living space or when their
welfare is threatened.  Dwarves detest drow, orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, and
evil giants, eradicating them whenever found.  Some strongholds are not
above ensalving such creatures and forcing them to work in labor camps. 
Their hatred of evil races is as ancient as the dwarves themselves. 
Originally, wars were fought to determine who had the right to live
underground, but the conflict has spread to the surface.  In most game
worlds there should be places where dwarves have been driven from their
ancient strongholds by orcs, goblins or other creatures of darkness.  They
now bear a burning and eternal hatred for them.  Dwarves have no doubt that
they are involved in a war of massive proportions.  It is known as the War
to the Death, for the dwarves have sworn to fight until their enemies are
destroyed.

The Orcs are large, brutal, and cruel in almost every way.  Their culture
is very warlike, with the orcs themselves dividing up into tribes.  Orcs are
also very strong and healthy as a result of the harsh life they lead, but
they lack the mental discipline and intellegence of other races.  Orcs
generally are over six feet in height, with olive drab skin, bulging
muscles, tusks, and bloodshot red eyes. They can only be Warriors, and
Anti-Paladins.

1 0 THE CREATION OF THE ELVES~
The Creation of the Elves From the primordial turmoil at the center of
the universe sprange the gods full- fledged, full-formed.  Each clamed
jusidiction over certain effects, all being equally endowed with the power
and the force of the cosmos.  The cooperated for the first (and the last)
time to create the worlds.  But some gods used their powers more wisely than
their brethren.  An early alliance formed among the wiser gods.  They knew
how to maniupate their power.  This gathering of gods, who called themselves
the seldarine (or the Brothers;and Sisters of the Wood), imparted their very
essence into creating certain aspects of the worlds.  While other gods
squabbled over jurisdiction and possession of this virtue and that
attribute, the Seldarine modified some of the lands, making their wolrds
lush and green and beautiful.  In addition, they created vessels that would
one day hold the spirit of the first sentient life to set foot upon these
worlds---the race of beings known as Elves.  They crafted these vessels with
tough and care, and gave them extraordinary beauty.  The other gods grew
black with jealousy, and they thirsted to imitate the Seldarine.  These gods
hastily fashioned their own vessels, veying against those created by the
Seldarine.  But they would not invest the time vital to creating a race, and
so their results were flawed---the gods did not care.  Their creations were
nothing like those shaped by the Seldarine.  Most were Monsters, creatures
that would one day haunt the dreams of Elves.  Of all the crude creations,
only the vessel reserved for man held a glimmer of potential, for they would
one day have the ability to change the land as would the elves.  The gods of
the new races tried to hastily reproduce a feat that had taken wiser gods
eons.  But neither group's constructs would not come to life until the
historic meeting between Corellon Larethian and Gruumsh, Leader of the
Anti-Seldarine.  ---Larian Songshine, priest of Corellon Larethian 
~
1 0 VARIATIONS OF ELVES~
Variations on a Theme There are nearly as many types of Elves as there
are Humans ...  Perhaps more.  After all, you Humans are different only in
appearance.  We Elves have more substantial differences, more than slight
dissimilarities in philosophy.  The Aquanesti, or Aquatic Elf as you call
them, is as different from a Grey Elf as a dolphin is from a mountain lion,
yet there are no petty racial quarrels between us that characterize the
existence of every race but ours.  What is the problem with Humans and
Dwarves that you cannot live in peace with your own?  Certainly, we once had
a history of intraracial conflict, but those days are long since past.  We
have our disagreements with one another, but we settle them like civilized
folkand I am beginning to believe that Elves are the only civilized folk in
all the realms known to mortals.  Although we continue to war with the Drow,
the cause of that war is far more than the color of their skin or their
beliefs.  It is the fact that their very existence is an affront to ours,
that they were created by perversions within our own race.  Our war is
nothing less than sublime effort to undo an error made hundreds of centuries
ago.  We do not judge anything by the color of their skin.  Granted, we find
it tempting to do so in the case of the Drow, but even we-who have so often
been betrayed by our darkskinned cousins-find it within ourselves to judge
each of them by their own merits.  Unlike the Humans, the Dwarves, and the
Small Ones, we Elves are not so much shaped by our heritage as by the way in
which we are taught to live.  Tales of Dark Elves who have the heart of High
Elves exist, as do tales of treachery and deceit among High Elves.  While
both cases are rare, they have happened-and will happen.  Always, we
attribute these to the way in which the Elf was raised, for we know that is
more important than blood.  The marked differences in our brethren appear
only when grand conglomerations make their individual traits societal. 
-Eronion Marathas, elven seer 
~
1 0 ELVEN PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES~
Physical Attributes Well, of course we're different.  We live longer,
often more than 400 years past the typical Human.  We can function easily
and comfortably in places where the only light is from the heat radiated by
our brothers-and our enemies.  Our skill with bow and sword has been called
paranormal by some, while others recognize this skill as simply the mastery
and artistry it truly is.  We do not even need sleep, instead deriving our
rest by dwelling within our memories and hopes of the past: the act of
Reverie.  Some claim this stagnates us and causes us to live in the past. 
This is not so.  We learn for the future by reliving the past.  We are the
overlords of the forest, and for good reason.  We are intimate with the very
soil on which we walk, for our souls are tied to the soil.  The ground
beneath our feet holds us up, never betraying us to the enemy.  Our forests
embrace us by hiding us in their branches, ensuring that we do not
inadvertently betray ourselves.  We can adapt to any environment anywhere,
and there are members of our race in places most have deemed too
inhospitable.  Although you may not see our brethren, you may rest assured
that they are there watching you ...  Making sure you do not do anything to
offend them.  We are, in short, the guardians and keepers of this world.  We
do not try to prove that we are naturally better than everyone else.  We
only know that our abilities far exceed those of most, and our long lives
give us the perspective to use these abilities to their fullest extent. 
This is not to say that the world should sit at our beck and call.  To the
contrary, we do what we can to ensure that we do not interfere with its
workings too greatly.  Indeed, we see our mission as one of restoring the
world after you others are done with it.  Unlike you people, our lives are
not devoted to the idea that we must change the world, for we are fully
aware that the world will change itself when it must needs.  -Laranis
Callirr, High Elf Ranger Elves generally resemble humans physically. 
Although they tend to be shorter and slimmer, they can often successfully
disguise themselves as small humans.  Without this disguise, however, their
true origins are readily apparent.  They are betrayed in this respect by
their distinctive countenance.  Many elves, however, find this is not a
problem they have no wish to be confused or identified with humans in any
way.  Elves have delicate chiseled features that are typically quite angular
and beautiful.  There is really no such thing as an elf born ugly those who
have low Charisma were either scarred accidentally or marred magically. 
However, Charisma is not only an indication of outward beauty.  The fact
that many elves have average Charisma is a testament to the fact that beauty
is not, contrary to popular belief, the only important thing about a person.
All elves are very slim, hiding their natural strength under a veil of
fragility.  Their slight build belies a power seemingly drawn from the earth
itself.  Looking at them, one would never believe that these creatures were
some of the most powerful ever created, or that they very nearly witnessed
the birth of the world.  Elves saw the rise of other races-the crawl of
humanity from the primordial ooze.  They are older than many trees and will
live to see generations of trees and humans alike.  Yet they hide this
innate power beneath a delicate exterior many thus assume they are harmless.
Elven hair and eye color varies by subrace.  This is, in fact, how many
people identify the separate types of elf at first glance, most especially
grey and high elves.  With other elves, the differences are often
immediately obvious.  However, it is still useful for any character to be
familiar with the various traits that distinguish the elf subraces.  One
interesting elven characteristic that few are aware of is the elves' lack of
canine teeth.  Since they sprang full-fledged into the form they now occupy,
they skipped the evolution process undergone by so many other races.  Thus,
although they are omnivores and their teeth are all strong, they have no
pointed, canine incisors.  Elven skin is usually quite pale.  The obvious
exceptions are, of course, the drow and the aquatic elves.  Even half-elves
are rather fair when compared to their human parents.  Of course, all elves
have pointed ears.  This affords them sensitive hearing, and they can hear
sounds unheard by human ears.  However, the range is not really great enough
to make a significant difference it is only enough for elves to distinguish
certain tones, which enables them to pass messages not meant for human ears.
This chapter discusses the physical aspects of elves, including innate
abilities, stages of life they go through, diet, and fertility.  It also
discusses two uniquely elven qualities: the elven bond and elven music. 
They are included here rather than in Chapter Four because of the physical
ramifications each has on elves.  
~
1 0 ELVEN PHYSIOLOGY~
Physiology Elves have certain abilities not accessible to most humans
except through powerful magicks.  They are aware that other races do not
have these faculties, and they take great pride in knowing that they are the
only mortal race blessed with them.  However, most elves do not treat other
races as inferior simply because they were born without these abilities
rather, they rejoice in their own uniqueness.  The elves feel truly blessed.
Among the abilities all elves are born with are communion, elvensight,
manifestation, the reverie, and a limited resistance to heat and cold.  
~
1 0 ELVEN COMMUNION~
Communion All elves have the inborn ability to share their experiences,
their feelings, and their lives with those elves they love or trust
implicitly.  This sharing, called communion, can only be undertaken by fully
willing elves.  It does not work with half-elves, nor does it function when
one of those participating has even the slightest reservation.  This
includes those under the influence of charmrelated spells, for they hold
qualms deep in their hearts, even if told they do not.  Communion requires
all elves involved (to a maximum of four) to be in a state of total
relaxation.  They must be in a place of peace, preferably where the world is
not likely to intrude with its troubles and its cares.  A natural
surrounding works best for this operation.  Communion requires the
participating elves to be totally serene, thinking only of the others in
this most intimate bond.  (Thus, communion is not an effective method of
relaying messages of;any urgency.)  All the elves must free themselves of
judgments and prejudices about the others, which may take some time. 
Indeed, some communions have been known to take a fortnight or more merely
in preparation for the bonding.  When the participants have sufficiently
calmed and retreated from the rigors of the world, they lightly touch palm
to palm, finger to finger.  They open their minds to the others, freely and
completely joining together if even a tiny reservation remains, the bond
fails.  During communion, the elves explore all the facets of the others'
personality-the loves, hatreds, hopes, and fears.  While in this trance,
communing elves are totally vulnerable to anything that might happen to them
physically, for they cannot defend themselves against any attacks while
communing.  Mentally, they are even more vulnerable to attack, saving at -4
against most mental attacks, for their minds are totally unguarded. 
Interestingly enough, the very act of communion offers a protection of
sorts.  Those in communion are defended against being spied upon, either
mentally or physically this defense takes the form of an invisible barrier
surrounding the communing elves.  It is speculated that the elves are so
enrapt with each other that they project a mental shield that keeps
discovery to a minimum.  Of course, this offers no protection against an
attack from someone who knows of the time and whereabouts of a communion. 
The benefit of communion is not only that elves learn the most secret facets
of others.  Because of the sharing, they also become intimately acquainted
with others' habits, fighting styles, and ways of thinking.  For the day
immediately following communion, the bonded elves can fight in perfect
harmony, one's weapon following through where another left an opening.  If
fighting side by side against common foes, they gain a +2 to attack rolls
and a -1 to AC for the next day only, and only if they work together.  All
the elves must have at least one partner from the communion at their sides
if this bonus is to be brought into play.  Communion can only be effected
once a week.  Those who try it more often with the same partners find
themselves sharing with essences that are essentially themselves, for those
who have participated together have shared enough of their spirits that
there is little difference between them.  Furthermore, communion tends to be
somewhat draining even while it invigorates.  Bonding so totally is simply
too much of a drain on one's psyche to be attempted lightly and frequently. 
Communion works best when the participants have something to learn or gain
from one another.

1 0 ELVEN SIGHT~
Elvensight Elves have extremely keen eyes.  Although they are not as
sharp-eyed as most birds of prey, their eyes are still sharper than those of
the average human.  In addition, their eyes have the ability to see further
into the infrared spectrum, allowing them to function in most unlighted
places.  In most landbound elves, this sight extends only to a range of 60
feet.  Aquatic elves, as described below, have an entirely different sort of
sight.  Naturally, there must be no other light at all for elvensight, or
infravision, to function.  If a greater intensity of light than starlight
(including moonlight from a half full or fuller moon) is within the elf's
line of sight up to 100 feet away, his or her elvensight will not work at
all.  Although the range of infravision is typically 60 feet, bright light
farther away affects them adversely.  Elf eyes must, of course, adjust to a
change in light.  They can no more immediately use their elvensight any more
than a human can immediately adjust to the sunlight after spending a time in
darkness.  ELVENSIGHT INFRAVISION Subrace Distance Type of Sight Aquatic
elves 360' Aquatic vision Drow 120' Infravision** Grey elves 60' Infravision
Half-elves 60' Infravision High elves 60' Infravision Sylvan elves 60'
Infravision * Aquatic elves do not have infravision, per se, above the water
however, they can locate their way or their enemies through dark and even
stormy waters by a version of infravision adapted to underwater
environments.  They do not see heat or cold, but rather the movements of
water currents.  ** Drow infravision is so intense that their eyes actually
radiate heat someone viewing a drow through infravision sees two burning
eyes atop a normally glowing torso.  
~
1 0 ELVEN MANIFESTATION~
Manifestation Despite the fact that elves are shorter than humans and
often appear childlike because of their height, they are usually not
discounted as such.  There are the rare occasions when they are, however,
and it is at such times that they invoke the elven ability manifestation. 
When elves wish, they have an imposing presence.  Suddenly, they can seem
far larger, more there, than their actual height and weight would indicate. 
They use this ability to good effect against impressible humans it keeps the
credulous ones at a distance and occasionally attracts necessary attention
to the elf.  The manifestation ability is purely a result of the elven
connection with the land the only trick involved is in demonstrating this
connection.  Naturally, manifestation does not work on planes other than the
Prime Material.  Furthermore, it functions only when the elf is in a natural
environment or in one that the elves have shaped, in which case they
generally do not wish to make their presence known.  Finally, manifestation
works only on an elf's home world or after an elf has lived on a world for
more than 50 years, whereupon the elf has grown used to the natural rhythms
of the world.  If an elf from Toril were to travel to Oerth, he could not
manifest for half a century.  After such time, he would have made the planet
his home.  To do the manifestation back on Toril, he would have to return to
that land and become reattuned to the planet.  Any elf away from his home
world for 50 years, no matter where he is, loses this ability until he
reattunes himself to the land.  Note that it takes only five years to
readjust to an original home world, unless an elf has attuned himself to
another.  In this case, he must endure the entire 50- year process, for he
has made himself a native of that other land, and must entirely readjust to
the cycles of his home world of old.  Manifestation has no real definition
in game terminology.  It is suggested that this ability allow a +3 on
reaction checks (reactions for enemies would be -3), as well as draw
attention to the elf in question.  This might be useful when trying to
distract a band of orcs from an injured party member or when attempting to
impress a simple woodsman.  Aside from impressing people, the power is
largely useless.  Elves are immune to this ability and any displays of it. 
They are aware of its presence when it is used and may admire the timing if
particularly noteworthy.

The COMMUNE command has been introduced to help with the RP of
Clerics/Paladins/Rangers. Since these three classes all get their powers from
their god/goddess they worship, they are communing that god/goddesses blessings

rather they Commune them from their god/goddess.

So a max of 60 BP may be applied to that specific weapon.
(Only exception to this rule is RARE items. To determine those simply 
multiply level x 5 instead)

Since Rulers enforce the Law, an applicant must
be familiar with the Laws. You WILL be quizzed.
Also, since some miscreants continually seek to
stretch or abuse the Laws, be able to apply the
Law to any theoretical problem not specifically
covered in the printed laws. Flexibility counts.
 
Rulers must also  know the territory.  Know how
to get from any  protected area directly to any
other one.  Also, know all the home towns (i.e.
"recall points").  Know how  to get  from place
to place without having to consult an area map.
 
Finally, there may come  a time when Rulers are
called to protect Midgaard from invasion. There
are unfortunately many routes to enter Midgaard
without going through  the gates.  One comes in
through the sewers,  and there are at least six
other ways in (differing by the 'first' room in
which you arrive in Midgaard.  Be aware of some
of these  unhappy holes in  Midgaard's security.
 
But, of course, being a Ruler is not only about
knowing things and  being able to answer a quiz.
You must  also prove  your sufficiency  for any
situation in which a criminal  may defy the Law.
You will be sent on a quest much like Questus's
to prove your mettle, and to verify your skill.
 
If any pure spellcaster should express a desire
to assist in enforcing the Law, he must also be
able to meet  such challenges.  If he is unable
to win a fight head-on, then he must at minimum
be able  to survive the event.   Therefore, any
such applicant  must memorize  a transportation
spell before requesting admission to the Rulers.
 
Finally, when promoting  the Law, one must also
promote respect for the Law,  and this can only
happen if the citizens have a respect for Ruler.
Every judicial act  reflects on the entire clan.
Since a reputation cannot be measured during an
interview, an applicant must  undergo a minimum
one-week waiting period  from when he announces
his desire to join,  during which  his roleplay
may be monitored  either by  existing Rulers or
trusted non-Rulers. Only those seen to be stout
of heart, strong of mettle,  and slow of temper
can expect  to be welcomed  into the Ruler clan.

The Rules of Immortal staff
           
1) Do not abuse your power in any way. This include but not
   limited to:                                             
              
   Killing mortals or doing something that leads to a mortals
   death.          
   Cheating for ANY mortals be it your own or a complete
   stranger.[Giving an any advantage or disadvantage to a player]
            [over another or mob.]
   [Some froms of cheating listed below]    
   (Tanking, spell ups, altering mobs, or loading them for mortals,)
   (handing out eq, giving special privilages, ect. ect.)
       
2) Do not kill shopkeepers of open areas.. No reason to.
          
3) Do not use REBOOT.  <--- Note, simple English.
   Only with a DM's permission are you allowed to do this.
 
4) Do not give out free equipment.
   Do not alter existing equipment for mortal use. 
   Quests are fine but handing out items isn't. 
   If you wish to reward an item for a quest have it oked
   by a immortal over the rank of 96.
          
   A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
   do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
   common sense here folks. If you question you reward just ask
   a immortal over the rank of 96. Also, if you have permission
   to run a quest where the reward is an item, do not set that
   items level below 4 of its normal one.
     
5) Do not undermine the authority of a Dungeon Master or any other
   immortal of superior rank. They are that rank for a reason. If
   you feel that a given immortal is abusing there right or being
   unfair let a DM or higher ranking immortal know immediatly. 
         
6) If you see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
   their priveleges without speaking with the immortal who did it. If that
   immortal can not be found, then find an immortal of high rank and let
   them know of the situation. 
   
7) Do not try to overrule each other, it causes more problems than it is 
   worth. If you have a disagreement with someone of the same rank as 
   yourself, seek higher council.  
        
8) Do not HANG in the same room as mortals. This is a DO NOT. Please
   stay in your area and talk and give help from there. You may
   hang with another imm (In the same room)or a hero in the chat room.
   Spending to much time in the mortal realms allows more room to break
   these commandments. We are not asking you not to speak with mortals
   but if you have business with them try to transfer them to a designated
   area first, also be polite. Check and make sure that person is ready to 
   be transfered. If that person doesn't respond then look for yourself, 
   before transfering. For the imms without this command use tells or ask
   an Immortal who does.
         
9) You are not allowed to QUEST. ARE NOT. There is no reason too....
   if for some reason you need quest points or something, ask someone
   with the set ablity to give you some. Simple as that.
                 
10) You cannot hold a rank in a clan other than "commoner." You also cannot have
    an alt in any clan ranked anything above second. This is to avoid a conflict 
    of interest. Also, clan business is mortal business unless you are told
    otherwise. So keep it that way.
           
11) Do not tell any mortal who your alt is, (or anyone elses). This is a big no.
           
12) You will not alter your mortal characters. You will not abuse your OOC 
    privaleges, (this meaning OOC knowledge, like other characters alts, stats, 
    etc.) Believe or not this is CHEATING.
           
13) No imm shall rename another imm. DO NOT DO IT. Unless you
    get a DM's approval for a rename you cannot be renamed. Also
    only a DM can rename an imm. No one else can do that, including
    yourself.
            
14) Using your alt to badmouth imms or publically disagree with an imm
    in an OOC context makes the whole staff look unprofessional.  It will not
    be tolerated.  You have plenty of oppertunity to discuss disagreement
    in an imm only fashion.
 
15) Do not ask for a promotion!

{DSince there is much debate about what {CRP{D (role play) truly is, I've decided that it'd be a wonderful idea to just give a general essay of guideline type stuff. It's nothing you need to follow religiously, but it is something that I will be encouraging, heavily, from now on. Role playing is something that keeps Dungeons and Dragons running. Without role play, D&D would be just another hack-n-slash piece of trash. But, as Thornan has made sure that role play is heavily encouraged, it is not a piece of trash. D&D is a wonderful work in progress that I'm sure all will grow to love. Either way, we still have much work to do and this little guide is just a way to regulate how things should work. As well, be mindful of your race/class when choosing a religion. It's very silly to see a Anti-Paladin Troll running around with the markings of Eros, or some other healing power that's just.....odd.{x
 
{wDespite popular believe, and the OOC channel, role play can be incredibly fun. Nab just the right person to play with and you can be taken into a whole other world that you may or may not have ever known existed. It's that easy. Just open your mind and close your eyes. Let your fingers do the walking and see, smell, hear, taste, feel everything you see in your minds eye.  If you want to get into a Clan, you'll have to be able to role play. As, I and some of the other immortals are going to begin to crack down on it.{x
 
{DWhat is {Crole play{D you ask? {CRole play{D is anything that your character does that makes them an individual, gives them a personality of sorts, makes them something other than a deaf/mute/blind blob. To role play a deaf/mute/blind blob, you'll have to do better than the one that used to be in the Mud School. Role play involves how your character see's things. It involves how they might react to a certain situation or to a certain topic of discussion. It involves how they talk, how they move, what they say and how they say it. It involves where they go to rank, where they don't go to rank, who their friends are, why they have or don't have friends. Role play is your best, and worst friend. Do it right, you'll have many friends who love to play scenes with you. Do it wrong, and no one will go near you except to kill you and loot you.{x
 
{wOne of the first rules of Pro-RP is this: {RDO NOT, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, FOR ANY REASON, EVEN TO SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE, ACT LIKE YOURSELF IN A ROLE PLAYING ENVIRONMENT. IT'S BAD FORM AND EVERYONE HATES IT{D.{x
 
{wGranted, it might seem like a valid RP reason, it's not. I've noticed that way too many people are beginning to do this and this will not be tolerated. Besides, I think it's much more fun to role play something that's not like you. Perhaps a mass murderer or an innocent child (whichever on you aren't) would be a good way to start. You should also consider this. What is your characters ethos-alignment combo? A lawful character (even though you personally may hate the cops and smell bacon or ham every time ones around) will not spit on a {BR{Yu{Bl{Ye{Br{w or {CKnight{w, or purposely harass either of them. A chaotic character (even though you may enjoy working with the police department and are the ass kisser of the month) will NOT, for any reason, seriously ask to help a {BR{Yu{Bl{Ye{Br{w or {CKnight{w out. A good character (even though they have those little fake vampire teeth from Halloween) won't want to suck anyones
{rb{Rl{ro{Ro{rd{w. It won't happen.{x
 
{DJust as well, an evil character (even though he may be an innocent looking little, harmless kid who sucks up to the teacher in school and makes good grads) doesn't mean he or she won't rip your throat out, your hear out, and then hand it back to you with a smile and stand there asyour {rB{Rl{ro{Ro{rd {Dcovers their entier body.{x
 
{wNow comes the more advanced stuff.{x
 
~
-1 0 RPRACE~
{Y================={x
{RAdvanced RP Race{x
{Y================={x
 
{CRACE - Some people say that you shouldn't RP race specifics, but I disagree. The reason I disagree is mainly that each race has strengths/weaknesses and those should affect who your character is. For example, a weak little gnome acting like he's a huge giant is good RP, where a huge giant acting like a huge giant is, to say the least, boring. Here are a few examples of things I have thought of for each race (and don't hold yourself to these things, they are just something additional that you can add to make things more exciting. Just as well, I've only been able to include the classes/races I've played. Any other info on a class/race is always welcomed ^_^). {RPLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE ARE ONLY SUGGESTIONS ON RACES THAT I HAVE PLAYED!{x
 
{DHuman{x - {DSomething to remember about humans is that they are common, standard, so perhaps a human would try to act like/claim to be another race to be different. 
 
{yGnome{x - {DOther than being gimped, a gnome is supposed to be peaceful and wise (which you may or may not want to go by. BUT, they are vulnerable to bashing, so perhaps whenever they see someone bash they cringe, or perhaps they try to be strong and combative. 
 
Half-{wE{Yl{wf{x - {DSince half elves are only half elf, perhaps they may try to act like a whole elf, or act very defensive when around elves. They may also try to act superior to humans. They may also act very curious and be interested in everything. 
 
{DD{ww{Da{wr{Df{x - {DDwarves are known for their quick tempers. This is one of the more important traits that SHOULD be used when playing a dwarf. Since they are resistant to magic, perhaps they think magic is weak (unless they are a mage). Also, since they don't like water, you should avoid using rivers and going across oceans at all costs (and get grumpy if you do have to). 
 
{wA{br{wi{ba{wl{x - {DArial are like humans, but are more individual, since they spend more time in the air than on land with others. Also, because of their weakness to disease, perhaps you could play an arial who was obsessed with germs. 
 
{RF{Yi{Rr{Ye{R G{Yi{Ra{Yn{Rt{x - {DBIG and STUPID. Should I repeat that? Fire Giants will not have the patience to sit down and listen to an intellectual discussion. They like to fight (because that doesn't take much brains). Because of their weakness to ice (and their lack of intelligence) perhaps a fire giant would totally forget the weakness and be shocked by it every time. 
 
{CS{ct{co{Cr{cm{C G{ci{Ca{cn{Ct{x - {DThese giants are smarter than the other giants (so would perhaps feel superior). Remember though, these are STILL GIANTS! So they shouldn't ever be or act as smart as an Elf. They also should tend to be more chaotic in nature (not necessarily chaotic ethos against Justice) but chaotic choices in living. 
 
{wE{Yl{wf{x - {DElves, being way smarter than almost every other race, might be a tad prejudiced against the more average classes (or they might feel sorry for them). Also, they would probably be less likely to want to kill since they are more intelligent. Perhaps because of their inability to use iron, they may think that iron is only for those who aren't too smart. ELVES HATE DARK-ELVES. 
 
{DD{ra{Dr{rk{D-{rE{Dl{rv{De{rs{x - {DBasically like evil elves, EXCEPT they are far more likely to discriminate because of intelligence, and far more likely to want to PK. They might not even speak to less intelligent races. They might spit on or ignore who wear silver/mithril because they can't use it. DARK-ELVES HATE ELVES.
~
-1 0 RPETHOS~
{Y=================={x
{RAdvanced RP Ethos{x
{Y=================={x
 
{CETHOS - THIS is a VITAL part of RP and PK in D&D and should NOT be ignored. Your characters ethos should be the center of their RP. {RPLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE ARE ONLY SUGGESTIONS ON ETHOS!{x
 
{wLawful -A lawful character normally never breaks laws on purpose. Most of the time, if they break a law it is strictly by accident. They wouldn't even consider it, because they are lawful. If you want to play a character who will break laws when a Ruler isn't around then play a neutral. Lawful characters follow the laws whether there is someone around to enforce them or not. Lawful characters may like rules, or order, so they don't just have to be good, any align can be lawful. There are some benefits to being lawful, despite common belief. First off it comes in handy when dealing with Rulers, and it creates a good beginning for a characters RP. 
 
{DNeutral - Someone with neutral ethos will be cautious of the laws (especially of Rulers), but not focused on the law. If they see a chance to break the law and not get caught, they might take the chance. Neutrals are more self centered, they do what they think is best for them. If there's a Ruler, then its best not to get caught, but if there is no Ruler, why not loot from a corpse if I need the stuff! 
 
{RChaotic - Chaotic characters do not care about Rulers at all. They will TOTALLY ignore the presence of a Ruler, to do whatever they want. If you want to play a character that doesn't want to get wanted, and won't break the law purposely with a Ruler around, then play a neutral! A chaotic character should break laws just because they can, not because they need something. Also, being chaotic doesn't just involve laws. They may be hasty to make decisions and make harsh generalizations when dealing with people. Being chaotic is a way of life.{x

0 0 rpalign~
{Y====================={x
{RAdvanced RP Alignment{x
{Y====================={x
 
{CALIGNMENT - Despite common belief alignment is also a VITAL part of RP in AR. This, along with ethos, should be the center and most important part of your RP. {RPLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE ARE ONLY SUGGESTIONS ON ALIGNMENTS!{x
 
{cGood - Goods help others. They are not hateful, except maybe towards evil. They don't always have to be friendly, but they should have some sort of conscious. A good character might have to deal with guilt if they do something wrong, like get damned. There are really two paths a good might think to take, but that does not leave others to take. They can either hate all evil PERIOD, no questions, or be only cautious of evils and willing to help anyone despite align. Either way, goods do not normally hate neutrals, unless given a reason of divine, or not so divine, quality. They might even just be a bit uncomfortable around them all together. 
 
{DNeutrals - Just like with Ethos, neutrals will think of themselves first. Whichever is more convient, or easier. They should be cautious of everyone but hate no one. Some neutrals may side with good more because they aren't blood thirsty, while other neutrals may side with evil more because evils get more goodies. 
 
{rEvils - Evils do not try to cooperate, they do not love, and for HEAVENS SAKE there is NOT a "fellowship or friendship or alliance" between evils! Evils should not trust anyone. They will NOT be safe in their guild. They will NOT be safe in a group. They have no true friends or alliances, and anything even resembling a "friend" or "ally" will only be for personal benefit. They do NOT go out of their way to help people. They are NOT friendly. Evils may or may not be aggressive, but no matter what they HATE everyone.{x

{Y===================================={x
{RSome Suggested Do's and Dont's of RP{x
{Y===================================={x
 
{c 1: Do try to develop a distinctive way of speaking. Please don't EVER say "M'friend." It just doesn't seem to fit, does it?
 
{g 2: Do RP even if you are naked and weaponless. Don't try to rape people who are naked and weaponless. 
 
{r 3: Do RP even while someone rapes you. Don't send tons of tells after your rape calling them a stupid loser who sucks. 
 
{b 4: Do RP consistently. Don't use a different RP for all of your personal moods. 
 
{y 5: Do let your character grow. Don't have the same outlook at level 50 that you had at level 1 (getting all the sub issue eq is not a good goal for a level 50). 
 
{m 6: Do let your character react to other characters RP, and let them react to yours. Don't plan a whole RP act and hope everyone sits and watches your performance (they might watch at first, but soon everyone will leave and you will be hopelessly lonely with no purpose to your miserable unimportant little life). 
 
{r 7: Do allow for the possibility that the character you designed to get into a cabal won't. Don't expect all your characters to get into any cabal you want them to get in, then 3 days after you send the application note delete because you think it's pointless to go on. Being rejected is something you can RP. 
 
{w 8: Do use original RP. Don't use the same RP for all of your characters despite race/class/ethos/align. 
 
{D 9: Do let your character take things personally (in their own way.) Don't let yourself take things personally (its just a game, and your characters business.not yours). 
 
{C 10: Do play your character as an individual separate from yourself. Don't let your personal life affect your characters RP (if you are dumped, that doesn't mean your character would talk about being dumped). 
 
{G 11: Do write an elaborate and descriptive description. Don't have all your evils wear all black and all your goods wear all white. 
 
{Y 12: Do try to get the best armor that you can. Don't write your description to reflect armor you don't have. 
 
{B 13: Do RP mages who are devoted to their magic. Don't ever practice detect magic. 
 
{M 14: Do combine your PK with RP. Don't PK with the RP reason "they pissed me off" AND especially not "they killed my other character." 
 
{R 15: Do RP constantly around Imms. Don't show off with new and inventive RP around Imms (don't let your character be abducted by aliens in the middle of talking to an Imm, rather.) 
 
{W 16:Do have fun with your RP. Don't assume that RP is for weenies and never even consider it when you are trying to be some badass vampire or legion (because believe it or not they both require RP.){x

{WThe Way of The {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W by Elhrohir Pallanen
{Y===================================={x
 
 
{WThe {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Gs{W are a simple class, they have clearly defined weaknesses and obvious strengths, but I will name them all anyway. {RPLEASE KEEP IN MIND, THESE GUIDE IS WRITTEN WITH REFERENCE TO MY EXPERIENCES WITH {GR{gA{GN{gG{GE{gR{GS{W! IF YOU WISH TO ADD TO THIS GUIDE, PLEASE WRITE IT IN A NOTE TO ME, THANKS!{x 
 
{rWEAKNESSES{W: {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Gs{W normally cannot lag or trip or whatever, and they can't use maces. They miss out on the Berserk skill. If they could use maces, or have the ability to berserk, lag and/or trip, then game would be unbalanced and not a grand idea.
 
{gSTRENGTHS{W: {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Gs{W have the potential to deal more round for round damage than any class in Dungeons & Dragons, except when compared with {DN{me{Dc{mr{Do{mm{Da{mn{Dc{me{Dr{ms{W. They get four defenses once they get bears, they learn almost every weapon, plus they get their foresting skills. They are fighters that can hide, and since more than half of Dungeons & Dragons is covered in hideable areas, a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W does not have to go very far to escape danger. With their pets, they can go toe to toe with anything in D&D "save the {DN{me{Dc{mr{Do{mm{Da{mn{Dc{me{Dr{W" and win. They are excellent for killing mobs also.
 
So you decide you want to try playing a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W. Or you decide to play one again for the first time, the first thing you will probably choose is your race/class/align/ethos/clan combination. Yep, that's the first thing you have to decide on. I'll give a rundown of the races first.
 
{DHuman{W: boring but no experience penalty and you'll probably have a rank advantage over whoever you fight. I would suggest playing one of this particular race if you are new to the {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W class.
 
{wE{Yl{wf{W: Why bother? The penalty is killer and elves make bad {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Gs{W period. The beasts make sneaking pointless, and {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Ws get quiet movement anyway, so your sneak is only good in half the areas, so I really don't see the point except from a Role playing perspective, and that's not the point of this essay. I am trying to teach you how to Kick Arse!! Though Role playing is equally if not, more important in the dungeons.
 
{wHalf E{Yl{wf{W: I'm going to give it about the same as the Elven {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Gs{W, the only difference is that I've never really truly gotten into the Half-Elf {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W. I found the first ten levels to be a bit tedious and would only recommend this race to the die hard fan.
 
{yGnome{W: Gnomes are the best fighting race in the dungeons. They make the best everything actually. A gnome {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W is a good idea. Hahahahaha! Take everything I just said and reverse it.
 
{yG{Di{yt{Dh{yy{Da{yn{Dk{yi{W: The Gith's strengths to intelligence and dexterity allow them to be able to move quickly, learn faster, and just.all around have a slight upper-hand. My experiences with the Gith's as a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W, I didn't find much difference to taking a human {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W and just suppin' him up with +dex gear. While the Gith's weakness to gaining wisdom and constitution each level will severally hinder their practicing abilities and hp gaining stats.I find them suitable, but not advisable.
 
{DS{ya{Dt{yy{Dr{W: The Satyr is actually a very good class to have, in my opinion, if deciding to create a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W. They get camouflage automatically, as well as ambush, and have a strength for dexterity. The only thing I find lacking about the Satyr is it's intelligence weakness.

{WThe Way of The {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W by Elhrohir Pallanen
{Y===================================={x
 
{W(cont.)
 
Now once you make your choice, you have to decide on which Clan. Currently I can only think of a few Clans that would allow a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W into their ranks. {YR{Bu{Yl{Be{Yr{Bs{W, {rS{Rc{ri{Ro{rn{W, S{wh{Dad{wo{Ww, {MC{Rh{Ba{Mo{Rs{W, {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{W, and {MSentinels{W. Wow, that only leaves {MW{ma{wr{Wl{wo{mc{Mk{W and {CKnights{W out of the loop.
 
Anyhow my first clan choice for a kick arse {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W would be in S{wh{Dad{wo{Ww. You can make those phantoms and equip them with almost anything, very useful depending on the enemy you face, also good for ranking or player killing when you're done ranking. The phantom itself even gives you more attacks and another defense, so five defenses and what, thirteen or fourteen possible attacks per round? My math may be off, but I kinda figure it's close enough. Though, it sounds like one killer formula for arse stomping. 
 
Second choice would most likely be {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{W. It's really cool to get all new abilities and be able to have animals that you normally don't get. I'd treat the {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{W clan like I would the  S{wh{Dad{wo{Ww  clan. The other clans I really don't know anything about. Oh well.
 
Now This might be getting boring, but too bad, because I haven't even taught you how to kick arse yet. Train your {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W up, learn the skills as you get them. Stop each time you gain a new one, put on those practice clothes and go block all those little snots that you practice on. Dual parry is at such a high freaking rank that you might as well learn it as you tank. Just wield a whip in your primary and a light sword as your secondary, it should be pretty high by the time you hit fifty. If you think what I say is blasphemy, then hold off on learning dodge until you do master dual parry. Always use two weapons unless you are fighting more than one arse.
 
 Then you will probably need a shield. I find that the only two skills that you'll really ever need to have at your every beck and call is disarm and dirt kick. I say that because if your opponent can't see you, he can't hit you. And if he's got nothing in his hands to hit you with, you're even better off. Always lead a fight with a dirt kick, and always counter one with it. Well, you might die, but if your opponent is blind you can just run and sleep a tic, or flee and run back in. If you cannot blind them, flee and get the hell out of dodge, if they trip you, dirt kick them, its all you really can do.
 
 Learn to dirt all your enemies if you are fighting a group, you can beat three at once if none of them know blind fighting. If there is a lull in the fighting, herb and then resume your hunt, unless of course you fight a thief or ninja. You don't want to get assassinated, so staying at half health is a good idea.
 
Now always be prepared for your fights, carry a couple purple potions, chances are if you are well trained, you won't need them unless its a handicapped fight, carry two recalls at least, and two gyvels, and perhaps a spotted purple pill. Any other spells and pills are alright, I don't want to give them all away. Dark red potion cures critical. Magenta cures critical and casts protection from evil. a Heart of a nymph can be eaten during battle, and cures critical, but they are heavy. 
 
Its a good idea to be as prepared potion wise as an {cA{Dn{ct{Di{c-{DP{ca{Dl{ca{Dd{ci{Dn{W is. That goes for every class. And leave your boat sitting in your inventory for god sakes. These are just a few simple tips that not everyone might know. Now I will give a breakdown of every class in D&D that I know how to fight, and how to kill them. Are you bored with the science of kicking arse with a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W yet?

{Y===================================={x
 
{W(cont.)
 
I use macros when I'm chasing. I usually program one to "dirt 'enemy name'" and another to murder them. You are going to learn to track well while playing a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W. And later on, all this tracking you'll do as a {GR{ga{Gn{Gg{Ge{gr will be good if you ever want to join up with the {YR{Bu{Yl{Be{Yr{Bs{W on another char. I guarantee it. And remember, some classes just can't be chased. I guess you should chase the same way you would while playing a {wP{Ya{wl{Ya{wd{Yi{wn{W. No lags suck but its necessary.
 
{wP{Ya{wl{Ya{wd{Yi{wn{Ys{W: can be tricky, don't let them summon you, move through the forests. Dirt kick them, and if you drink a purple beforehand, they cannot win. Catch them with sanctuary down and it will only take a round or so. 
 
{cA{Dn{ct{Di{c-{DP{ca{Dl{ca{Dd{ci{Dn{cs{W: These <censored> can be tricky, but unless they catch YOU off-guard, you should win. Your worst danger is around rank thirty, when the novelty of your pets begins to wear down, and their fireball rules the night. Use dirt kick. They have no blind fighting, and if you can go quicker, they will go down hard. They get easier after rank thirty. Stay camouflaged in the forests and they won't catch you, let your pets go if you have to, cause at rank thirty they won't last through two rounds of fireballs.
 
{DW{ra{Dr{rr{Di{ro{Dr{rs{W: If they use a mace and you don't have the right equipment to fight them, they can also be trouble, but use two whips and they can go down in one round. Disarm the mace. If it can't be disarmed, dirt, flee, then run the <censored> down. That technique almost never fails. Sometimes the fighter will be especially good or have clan powers. Stock up on purples, and use two whips. Use all the potions and advantages you can, lots of damage will be spent on both sides, use every slight edge you can get. Hopefully you will win, if you clearly aren't run, and hide. Herb and re-attack, you might win still.
 
{DT{Wh{Di{We{Dv{We{Ds{W: These little annoying <censored>! Bribe another thief to reveal their positions. Thieves can be killed, set your macros to follow them before you dirt, it might work. Unless they are especially bold or stupid, you will have a hard time catching them. Never been killed by a {Dt{Wh{Di{We{Df{W though. Well not as a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W anyway so I guess it works both ways.
 
{DNinja{W: Lite {Dt{Wh{Di{We{Dv{We{Ds{WEasier then thieves. Make sure you're note at full health. Remember you can hide in forests if the battle is long and drawn out, but pouncing, and pouncing hard on these two classes is the best way.
 
{DN{me{Dc{mr{Do{mm{Da{mn{Dc{me{Dr{W: Oh my god these <censored> are overpowered. There's small things you can do, if you are at equal ranks, the fight usually goes to {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W, but these guys are almost unkillable. Can't be lagged by you, and they have better pets. I've never fought an {DN{me{Dc{mr{Do{mm{Da{mn{Dc{me{Dr{W for longer than two rounds strait, ALWAYS use a purple. And don't stay in the fight at all, you could spam flee, that could wear him down, and if you get one good round in with your pets. 
 
Also try making them gate to you, DIRT them, and set a trap. Wait by a clan guardian or inside a no escape pit. Of course they could catch you in the pit, but all my troubles with {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Ws this age have come from {DN{me{Dc{mr{Do{mm{Da{mn{Dc{me{Dr{ms{W.
 
 And one or two lucky {cA{Dn{ct{Di{c-{DP{ca{Dl{ca{Dd{ci{Dn{cs{W who caught me while fighting mobs. Terrain is such a <censored>. Actually, best thing to do is to hide and not bother to fight when a {DN{me{Dc{mr{Do{mm{Da{mn{Dc{me{Dr{W has his mobs. Especially if its him coming after you. Or just adhere to what I've already said.
 
{cW{Ditc{ch{W/{DW{carloc{Dk{W: The one round wonder. Catch them without sanctuary and they are dead, you could probably kill them in two or three rounds with sanctuary. Never had a problem with an lone invoker before. Usually can deal more damage to them through their sanctuary than they can through your nothing. Dirt em too. Of course at a low rank like fourteen they will turn you into a stain. 
 
{CC{cl{Ce{Cr{ci{Cc{cs{W:: Hard to kill, annoying, but they really have no way of hurting you. Dirt them, and try and take out their weapon, most likely they will run from you, after making you glow. Maybe if they used divine retribution and a whip, and summon you to water... you still should be able to kill them.
 
{GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Ws: Hrmm, usually this is rare, but just be the first to initiate, use two whips, and dirt, then hunt them down. If your pets are better than theirs more power to you. Use a purple and ride on their <censored> when they run.
 
{rV{Ra{rm{Rp{ri{Rr{re{W: Uhm, nine times out of ten it will be them attacking you. The other one time, five people will join you. Just be sure to hit the last blow or at least get the crap off the ground when they die. Remember these corpses don't leave steaks.
 
Now that you know how to kick arse with a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W, I don't <censored> want to see you gangbang. A {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W should never have to gangbang, but group fights with a {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{W at fifties are awesome, you'll probably play the role as tank or cleanup. 
 
And {GR{ga{Gn{gg{Ge{gr{Ws are also really good at defending themselves when THEY are attacked. An unprepared counter strike is always killer. Store macros up for who you think will attack you, and let em have it when they do. be sure to leave your group and use your pets if you are ranking when they attack.

{CIn our world, there will always be those players who just can't role play to save their own lives. And then, there will be those players who know everything and anything there is to know about role playing. These role players are the role players we need to pay careful attention to.{x
 
There are certain things that you will need to consider before you begin your description. As it is, creating your description is the first step you'll be taking into role playing. You'll need to consider your characters race and class. Why? Because race and class determine your height, body structure, and physical appearance.  While the class you chose will affect your characters personality, whether or not he or she is intimidating or clean or dirty, etc. Knowing about your race and your class is the second step you'll need to take in getting prepared for role play. The best way to prepare, is actually, just to look at your class, find and read the help file for it, then find and read the help file on your race. This is a very obvious thing to do and should definitely be done by everyone, regardless. Keep in mind this one factor. Your class sets limits upon your description.
 
{CMoving on. Once everything is set and decided, what you need to do next is examine your characters race and class again, then examine your characters ethos and alignment. How does each of these things affect your characters RP? How does your character feel about the certain aspects of other races and classes? Or is your character just as mean and hateful to everyone and everything that isn't like him? There are things that you'll need to remember. Characters who are good may have a smile on their face because they are friendly, or they may have a frown on their face because they are the "starving artist" type. Something terrible happened to them, but it did not shake their fait and they still follow it religiously. 
 
And, also, keep in mind that an evil character might have a smile on his face - not because he's friendly, but because of some sick, twisted, perverted thought he or she might have just had. Or he or she may wear a frown because of a wrong they were dealt and it shook their faith from good and shifted to wherever they stand now. The hardest part about RP is deciding how your character will respond, act and interact with other characters. To shift back to descriptions for a moment, as I've seen it too many times:{x
 
There are some things that should never be included in your description. A description should only contain your physical appearance, how you walk, or the way your voice sounds. There should be no actions. An example of an action might be something like "He growls at you as you walk past" or "He charges everyone he sees". You can say, however, that he growls when he talks, or that when he walks he looks ready to charge. There can be no ansi art. Don't tell how you feel or what other people think. "He loves everyone he sees", or "You are scared at the sight of him" would not be allowed. While, "he smiles with love" or "he looks scary" would be allowed. Yet, you can mention some simple symbol, like a necklace or ring that signifies a clan or something of that sort. Finally, a description is only for how you look, not your history or purpose. People should be able to figure out your history and purpose by talking to you, not looking at you. 
 
{CRemember, it's just like real life. If I were to describe myself to someone, I wouldn't describe how I think, or how you would think about me, or actions that I do, or the clothes I am wearing. I would tell you my height, my hair, my face size and shape.things like that. The things you want to describe are the same things that you can tell by walking past someone in the mall. Though clothes are a part of that, the clothes don't make a person, since they can change clothes so easily. Just remember, first you want to think of what your character is like, then set out some simple words that you believe describe your character's personality, then use a thesaurus to find the most appropriate words, and finally write it all up. Remember, looks are everything, just like first impressions. You don't want to ignore them!{x

Builders with the Maintenance job are broken up into 4 sub-catagories*.
              
1) Typos
2) Help files
3) Object Balancing
4) Area Balancing
             
In general terms a Builder Maintenance immortal's job is to maintain the upkeep
of the Mud World. They do this by doing one or more of the sub-catagories listed.
Normally A Builder Maintance Imm will only have one or two sub-catagories assigned,
though on special occasions they can have as many as three. No Imm should attempt
to do all 4 of the sub-catagories. This just causes to much stress for the immortal,
and could lead to hurried work or neglection of there duties. If at any time you
think that you cannot handle the work load assigned, simply let your superiors know.
As with most jobs you will have a boss, and in this field of building that boss will
be known as the BM Admin. (Building Maintance Administrator) which will be assigned
normally to someone of higher rank. (Though a few exceptions may occur.. exa. a rank
97 Role play imm decideing to take on some Bm responsibly as well might find that a 
rank 94 is to be there BM Admin.) No worries though, a BM Admins purpose to assign
work and keep an eye on progression. Bm Admin isnt listed as a sub-catagory for many
reasons most being that they are responsible for there own sub-catagories like the rest
of the BM staff, though normally only take on one sub-catagory themselves.
            
*  Each sub-catagory is explained in its own help file* and should refer to there
   specific job help file for there job description and regulations.

Job Description:
               
    Fixing typos and grammatical erros in all text related material on the mud.
    This includes: Room descriptions, Mob descriptions, Object descriptions,
    Help files*, Mob short/long descriptions, Object short/long descriptions,
    Mpcoded text (such as mob dialogue), and in some cases even hard coded
    text messages. 
            
    This might seem a very daunting task but nevertheless it is important. 
    Typos are reported on the forums to make you job a bit easier. Though,it 
    may still be hard to find the exact location of the typos. When a typo is 
    reported and you fix it, you should report the area, room vnum and line of
    the typo you fixed on the typo section of the forum. Reason being so that
    any other in charge of correction typos/grammer will know that it has 
    already been corrected. If by some chance it was a Coded error or Mob/obj.
    related then either say the uncorrected sentence then corrected one, or tell
    the mob/obj vnum, mpcode vnum, or any other applicatable information along 
    with the uncorrected sentence. If the typo/grammer error is in a help file
    the help file keywords and location of error is all that are needed.

Builder Maintenance -- Help Files
  
Job Description:
   
    The creation and revision of help files. Though this job seems simple enough
    there are a few things you should consider when creation or reviseing any 
    help file. 
   
    These are: 
   
   Color Scheme - When using color keep in mind that the players who read these
                  tend to have different background and font colors. This doesn't
                  mean that you cannot use colors, though using colors like {{d for
                  instance should not be done since most clients dont even recognize
                  that color. When using color try to be considerate, bright colors
                  should be avoided in most cases, an exception would be if you need
                  to draw the readers attention to an important section. Try to keep
                  most of the base text uncolored, though if you do use a color for
                  the normal text, try to use something easy on the eyes, and keep it
                  a solid color. (Yes, there can be to much color) You are not required
                  to use color in any help file. Though, a little wont hurt.
                
   Formating    - When formating a help file try to keep it neat. The regular :f command
                  isn't always going to cut it. What I suggest you doing is writing it
                  in a program such as Notepad first, and using Multi-line send if your
                  client is capable. Otherwise you will have to take great care to keep
                  your help files looking neat and making them easy to read.
                        
   Keywords     - When creating the keywords for a help file try to use words that are
                  related strongly to the help file being created. Also, it is nice to 
                  keep them as short as possible, if you do use long or multiple keywords
                  try to add an abbreviation* if you think that a player might want to
                  look refer to the specific help file on multiple occasions. Also using
                  words such as "of", "the", and the like are not neccassary since
                  keywords are what the mud uses to locate any relative help files of the
                  user's search, though it won't hurt anyone if you wish to use them.
                        
                  * (exa. Help History of the Hill Dwarves One  HD 1)
                          
    Wording     - When writing your help file try to keep in mind that it is a 'help
                  file', and is there to help. Try to word the help in a way that it
                  doesn't imply one must do as this says when regarding to things such as
                  roleplaying helps and the like.

0 0 MULTIKILL~
The intention of the multikill rule is to grant some repreve to those who
do not enjoy being PKed over and over again.  In that vein we have established
that after you Kill someone you are not allowed to attack them again for
24 hours (real time) without a NEW reason.

Some people have requested we clarify this rule so that they may abide by it.

{WThough in the following we talk of {RKilling{x {Wwe really mean {rATTACKing{x.{.

{REvery{z PK must have an RP reason behind it.  And while we'd {Rprefer{z that the
reason were based on the victim's actions, we realize that most often people
are killed for their intrinsic nature (evil, elf, vampire, witch, paladin etc).

However, after the first kill you {Rcannot{x use intrinisic attributes as an RP
reason to kill someone a again.  Thus, an evil drow Warlock witch cannot be
killed by a good elf Barbarian first for being evil, a second time for being
drow, a third time for being in Warlock and a forth time for being a mage.

Nor can you kill someone first because they attacked you, and then a second
time because they are a vampire.

Once you kill someone, {Rall{x known reasons to kill them are {Rnullified{x.
You {RMUST{x base your subsequent kills on something they have done since the
last time you killed them.  The notable exceptions to this are if someone
posts a bounty on the victim after you kill them, but for something they did
before you killed them, and if someone is raiding your clan hall.

{r*{R NOTE{x: {Wthese rules are devised so that if you want to avoid being PKed again
        you should be able to, provided you mind yourself.{x

Okay, the following are just a few VALID reasons to attack someone again:

{W1){z {GThey attack you.{x
       {w(This includes {gautoassist{zing on someone, which is considered the
       same as typing 'murder player'.  It also includes any spell, skill or

       attack or defend yourself, such as making you unable to cast spells.){x

{W3){z {GThey steal from you.{x

       {gDOES{z include trying to frame you for something you did not do, and
       cases where the victim did not abide the law himself.){x

{W8){z {GThey convince someone to harm you.{x

{RIF YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR AREN'T SURE ABOUT A SITUATION, CONTACT AN IMMORTAL.{z

Some situations that have popped up:

---
Player {BA{z attacks Player {RB{z, but Player {RB{z wins and kills his attacker.
Player {RB{z then later attacks and kills Player {BA{z. This is {MNOT MULTIKILL{z,
because Player {BA{z instigated the first fight, where player {RB{z instigated
the second.
---
Player {BA{z attacks and kills Player {RB{z. Player {RB{z then groups with
Player {YC{z. Player {BA{z attacks Player {YC{z, and Player {RB{z autoassists;
Player {BA{z kills Player {RB{z (and perhaps even Player {YC{z). This is {MNOT
MULTIKILL{z, for a couple of reasons; 1, Player {BA{z didn't attack Player {RB{z,
Player {RB{z actually attacked HIM when he autoassisted Player {YC{z; and 2,
if we ruled that attacking a groupmate constituted attacking everyone in the
group, Player {YC{z could just group with Player {RB{z just to protect himself
from Player {BA{z, making him unfairly safe under the multikill rule.
---
Player {BA{z attacks and kills Player {RB{z. Player {BA{z later casts a room-affect
spell such as {CDeadly Venom{z, {CMysterious Dream{z, {CCursed Lands{z, {CEvil Spirits{z,
or similar spells or skills (but NOT a spell or skill that HITS A ROOM, such
as {YEARTHQUAKE{z). Player {RB{z dies from the affects he got when he wandered into
the room where the spell was cast. This is {MNOT MULTIKILL{z, because Player {BA{z
did not specifically target Player {RB{z, and even if the spell was cast while
Player {RB{z was in the room, Player {RB{z still had time to leave the room
before the spell affected him.

If they do not need it they will leave it behind for anyone who might
find it and need it. The only things they destroy are those that are imbued

-2 0 'PALADINS SKILLS'~
Paladin, Paladins, Holy Warriors of the gods.
 
These warriors have chosen the path of virtue and chivalry above all
others.  This dedication to their cause grants them priest-like spells and
healing powers.  They are also formidable fighters, always questing to stamp
out evil.  Paladins must stay good in order to cast their spells.  Those who
forsake goodness are strongly frowned upon.  Paladins are the epitome of all
that is good and true, and they will gladly sacrifice their lives for their
beliefs.

85 0 Builder Maintenance (d) Area Balancing BM D~
Job Description:
        
     Those with this job are required to balance out new/old areas with the others. Good 
     area balancing is required to have a well rounded balanced game. To much great eq
     here, to few there, lots of gold in this area, ect., ect., hurts the game profoundly.
     So those with this job will be in charge of keeping each area well balanced with the 
     other areas. This doesn't mean if a over balanced area somehow manages to get accected 
     that you just make all the other areas the same to 'balance' them. This won't fix 
     anything. What you should do is tone down the new area.
              
     How to tone down/up an area to find a balance with the rest-
                     
     First you need to see what the balance issue is with the problem, be it the amount of
     gold or uber equipment. Then you go through the mobs and shop keepers, and fix them.
     Pretty simple in theory right... wrong. To actually balance them out with every other 
     area takes alot of time and thought. So if your an impatient person with a limited 
     imagination, this isn't the job for you.
        
     When an area is needing balancing, or after you have balanced it, you should report to 
     the Imm. above you as well as post it on the forum under the correct location.
     Also, people with this job might at times be asked to recreate an area using previous
     rooms and mobs/objs. In order to bring it up to the new guild lines and code.

85 0 Area Creation~
Job Description:
  
    Area Creation is as simple as these few things-
                      
          Area theory/background - 
             
                   Come up with a good idea of an area or "story". These stories are
                   important to the mud since they give the player a place to interact
                   and play. A good story can go along way.
                   A poor one won't go anywhere.
     
          Area Mapping/Digging -
               
                   Map out your areas first. An easy to read map will aid you in building
                   a wonderful area. Also your maps should be easy to dig out. That way 
                   you don't confused while digging out your area and make a mistake that
                   you might not notice.
                        
          Creating objects and Mobs -
                   
                   Use common since when creating objects and mobs, ALL mobs should be
                   part of your story. They should have an roleplayed sense about them.
                   (A fido won't be wielding a long sword, and be affected by uber spells
                   ...even if it is a giant mutant space fido). Make sure you follow the 
                   builder guidelines at all times. If you have a question about them ask.
                   It is better to ask about them, or one you think should exist, then to 
                   just assume there fine. Assumtions might have you wasted valuable time
                   going through your area once again.
       
          Mobs continued -
                      
                   When making an with mobs, try to use mpcodes. If you are unable to 
                   create these, don't be afraid to ask for assistance. Mpcodes can help 
                   make an area WONDERFUL and FUN. 
                             
    By following these guidelines there is no reason why you can't create fun and 
    intersting areas for all to enjoy.
                                             
Job Restrictions:

85 0 Builder Helper~
Job Description:
                          
    Being a builder helper means that you are to aid builders in the creation of there
    areas, as well as other building duties. There are two ways to perform this duty.
                       
    One - 
         Standard builder helpers are to perform small tasks for a higher builder in order
         to gain more building experience. Normally for a newly recruited builder or a 
         Immortal who wishes to build.
                                         
    Two -
         The second way is to help the builder with ideas for creation, and any problems 
         they run into while building. Such as Mpcodes, building syntex, and etc. Normally
         most builders will do this without it being there job. The builder community is a 
         very helpful one. Though haveing a few experienced builders assigned to this duty
         will allow builders to accomplish there jobs at a faster more productive rate. 
         (Won't have to wait for another builder to find time to help) We encourage 
         questions, and there is/will be a an OLC page that should be of much use when you
         have any building questions.
                                       
Job restrictions:
                                            
     BH One-
           Only allowed to do things that are assigned to you.
     BH Two- 
           Must attempt to help a builder when asked regardless of what you are doing at
           the time. (Few exceptions. Such as if you are in the middle of performing
           another job at the same time and other things that might apply)
     BOTH-
           Building must be done on the build port.

      Relative to the task one is performing ( Once a builder helper becomes proficient
      in a command they are able to keep it. When they are proficient in all builder comm-
      ands they are then are tested to see if they are ready to become a full fledged
      builder)

85 0 Area Approvel~
Job Description:
                                                     
    Those in charge of Area Approvel are required to look through a builders area after
    they complete it and check to make sure that it is well balanced and follows the 
    builder guidelines. Check for any flaws such as unconnected rooms, broken mobs,
    missing descriptions (exit, exd, mob, obj, and of course rooms). Once you are asked
    to approve said area, that area becomes your responsiblity as well. Meaning if it is
    found to be unbalanced both you and the builder will be help accountable and may be
    required to go through and fix it together. Also, if found to do this often you will
    be removed of your job and demoted to a lesser building job.  (OH NO TYPO DUTY!!!)
                                     
Job Restictions:
                          
    Must post approved areas on forum as well as report which areas you are in the process
    of approving. All approvel must be made on the build port. All changes to the area you
    are approving must be made by its creator. Not allowed to approve your own areas!
    Must have been a builder for atleast 3 months on this mud to be able to obtain this
    job.

0 0 CHANNELS TELL NEWBIE OOC GOSSIP YELL SHOUT TRADE MUSIC IMMHELP~
Simply put, there are two types of channels.  In Character (IC) channels, and
Out Of Character (OOC) channels.  However, there also exist channels that allow
both IC and OOC conversation.
 
OOC content, but when possible, roleplay is strongly encouraged. However, it is 
not always possible to discuss things in a roleplay sense.
 
{mNewbie{x (OOC)
Syntax: newbie <string>
This channel is used for newbies to ask technical questions, and for non-newbies 
to answer those technical questions, or offer a suggested help file for the
newbie's question.
 
{WMusic{x (Either)
Syntax: music <string>
This karaoke channel has been reserved for immortal use since the international
incident of the year of the bull, when all the windows in Thera were shattered
simultaneously due to a cacophony of miscarried tunes.
 
{GTell{x (Either)
Syntax: tell <player> <string>
When using this channel with players you do not know, it is better to RP what
you tell them, however, OOC conversation is fully permissible, and you may speak
freely. NOTE: This does not mean you are allowed to abuse that (or any) player.
Disciplinary action will be taken if such is found to be the case.
 
{GGtell{x (Either)
Syntax: gtell <string>
When grouped, you can use this channel to freely communicate with your party.
The rules that apply to tell also apply to gtell. Note that most forms of
concealment will not be spoiled upon usage of this channel, unlike others.
{CIC Channels{x
These channels are used as if your character was speaking solely as himself and
for himself. While manufacturing a whole new manner for speaking for your
character isn't required, it does enhance the atmosphere, and will receive
special consideration. In addition EMOTICONS are NOT ALLOWED on roleplay
channels. Examples of EMOTICONS include internet smileys :-), internet critters
{M|____{B..{M__|{x ,,,{B>{R;;{B<{x,,,, and such. Although internet abbreviations are allowed
(lol rofl btw), and meta-actions ({R*{xcringe{R*{x {B::{xsighs{B::{x) ARE allowed, they're
oftentimes inappropriate. Excessive usage of these shorthand items detract from
the MUD, and should be used sparingly.
 
{RGossip{x (IC)
Syntax: gossip <string>
The gossip channel is an outlet for your character to speak with the world of
Thera about things that pertain to their character's life and opinion.

{DPlease see {xhelp 1.gossip{D for additional information.{x

{YShout{x (IC)
Syntax: shout <string>
The shout channel is akin to the roleplay channel, except that it is the
preferred outlet for IC arguments, vocal grudge matches and the like.
 
{MYell{x (IC)
Syntax: yell <string>
The yell channel is similar to the shout channel, except that it only works in
the immediate vicinity. NOTE: Some actions, such as dirt kick, strangle,
blackjack, backstab, and others, when performed on certain people automatically
incite a yell from the individual.

{yTrade{x (IC, lightly enforced)
Syntax: offer <string>
The trade channel has replaced the auction block so that you may freely list
your requests to trade money for items, or items for money. Tone is not
strictly enforced so as to minimize the time spent gabbing. This is a
business channel, after all, and time IS money.
 
{COOC Channels{x
Out of character channels are exactly that. They can include any kind of
conversation available. Your characters, however, have no knowledge about what
is said over OOC channels, and therefore should not be influenced to act upon
what is said over OOC channels, generally.
 
{BOOC{x (OOC)
Syntax: ooc <string>
This allows an OOC conversation with the entire world. It is not applicable to
the actions of your character, nor should your character react to another's
character based on things said on the OOC channel, generally.
 
{WOther Channels{x
 
{GIMMHELP{x (OOC)
Syntax: immhelp <string>
This channel is for player-needs-immortal-assistance. Use this channel if you
need to speak with the immortals, but do not abuse it.
 
{WChannel-related Commands{x
 
{WChannels{x
Syntax: channels
This command provides you a list of all your channels and their ON/OFF status.
NOTE: In order to turn on/off any given channel, simply type the corresponding
channel command without any arguments. For example, "gossip"
 
{CQuiet{x
Syntax: quiet
Toggles quiet mode.

{wTwit{x
Syntax: twit <name>
Adds the name of an individual to your twit list. You will no longer receive any 
channel-related contact from this person.

This skill allows the warrior to use the haft of his/her weapon to block
incomming attacks. The haft is the part of the handle where the pommel
and the blade meet.

-1 0 HOW TO CREATE A CLAN~
Starting a new clan is kinda like becoming a student at a zen buddhist
monistary; you show up declaring your enthusiasm and the monks rebuff
you, and ignore you for weeks.  Most applicants give up and head home
discouraged.  Only the most dedicated stick around to eventually become
monks; and that's the idea.

Constructing a clan takes some work on the IMMs' part, and distracts us
from our other duties.  We don't mind, as long as people aren't just going
to get bored and abandon the clan a month after we create it.  The
playerbase is such that even right now the clan populations are a little
thin.  So adding another clan is something we do with hesitation.  But
if you're persistant, and really prove that your new clan idea will
flourish in the mud, then we're ready to do it.

Here are the requirements for making a new clan:

{c1{D){x Your clan must have a binding roleplay idea that unites your peoples.

{c2{D){x You must have 3 or more members who publically pursue your clan's
        agenda for at least a month.  Please note, that it is easiest
        for the IMMs to spot persistant RP in the global channels.

{c3{D){x You must outline (usually on the forums for discussion) a specific
        roleplay goal for your clan, which includes who your natural
        enemies are, and what it means to fullfill your objectives.
        Clans w/o enemies are rather stale on an PK mud.

{c4{D){x Your clan must be based on interactions with others, and must somehow
        enhance the roleplay possibilies of a certain percentage of the
        mud's population.  If it is too limited, or too narrow, it won't
        look viable in our eyes.  The same goes for it being too general.

{c5{D){x Do {RNOT{x base your clan on expected clan skills!  You can not expect
        your clan to gain skills for up to a year after it is created.
        This is to deter people from creating clans just to gain new
        skills and with flimsy RP purpose.

Okay, after the above criteria have been satisfied in the eyes of the IMMs,
you will be slated to receive a WHO clan-tag and a clan-channel.  At this
point you'll be more of a "tribe".  If clan participation keeps up during
this period your next step is to find an IMM patron to build your clan
hall.

92 0 Clans 'CHANGING CLANS'~
Here are the requirements to those wishing to join another clan.
 
1. All changes of clan must be roleplayed.
 
2. A note to your old clan must be written in a roleplay manner, declaring
your reasons and stating your intentions and disposition toward the old
clan.
 
3. There is a {RONE WEEK{x waiting period once you leave the old clan and
are able to enter the new clan.  This {RMUST{x be a week of active play.
You cannot disappear for the week and then re-emerge to join the new
clan.  Anyone caught doing this risks being denied access to any clan,
or having the waiting period doubled, starting the date of re-emergence.
 
The reason for this last rule it to give your old clan a chance to hunt
those who commit treason, or reject their values, yet carry their secrets
to another clan.  Jumping clans should be a risky endevor.

When adjusting the cost value of an item, please try to stick close to the
amount that Autoweapon and Autoarmor yields if it's a weapon or armor.
Otherwise, just use common sense. If you create something that has too high of
a cost, the value of gold decreases, and the economy of the mud gets messed up.

0 0 sirala~
Sirala is the Goddess of Twilight, and is worshipped by those who have
dedicated their lives to the pursuit of balance and neutrality.  Those who
worship her do not look at the world in terms of good and evil, but rather
they see life as a perfect balance, everything having a place and a purpose,
from the smallest flower to the largest dragon.  
 
Those who dedicate themselves to her path are ultimately interested in 
ensuring that this balance is maintained, and they will fight to keep it that 
way if they must. Good must never triumph completely over evil, nor evil 
over good, and civilization and nature must always be kept in balance, 
with neither one nor the other gaining too much ground.
 
         To yourself: Cure Critical
         To your good enemies: Dispel good
         To your evil enemies: Dispel evil

{W1){x Sentinels are not only avengers, but defenders. But when one cannot defend the weak,
a Sentinel must avenge the plights of the tormented.
{W2){x While it is in our nature to rid the world of evil, Sentinel realizes that it is
sometimes more beneficial to not destroy evil than to destroy it. "Keep your friends
close, but keep your enemies closer." Good can be twisted to unknowingly perform evil
deeds, but evil can also be twisted to perform good deeds, as well.
{W3){x To maintain one's purity, one must not be tainted by evil. That is to say, it is
one thing to attempt to goad evil into performing a task, it is a complete other thing
to torture evil mercilessly, without proper provocation. It is to the discretion of the
individual what consists of "proper provocation," however.
{W4){x To err on the side of caution keeps one's actions pure, but to err on the side of
haste keeps one's intentions pure. If you feel you must "take the shot," then do so. Be
prepared to answer to any consequences. Likewise, if you fail in your duties as the
defender, you must answer to those consequences, too.
 
{cOOC:{x
{DAs a result of being a "good" clan, it falls on us to be looked up to by the newbies
of the realm. For this reason, these rules are in effect to better attract newbies, in
addition to improving the quality of life at D&D.{x
 
{w1){D People that are conceived to be level 30 and below are considered to be newbies.
Newbies, as a result of not necessarily being "set in their evil ways," may not be 
attacked on the premise of being an AP, Vamp, Drow, etc. Simply being evil isn't
enough provocation - but evil actions are.
{w2){D If you are compelled to attack a newbie, try to scare him off, and explain to
him why he shouldn't do what he has done, and issue any threats deemed necessary.
Killing is an option, of course. But if you do kill him, explain to him that you're
doing because RP demands it.
{w3){D Don't loot a newbie. If a newbie gets looted as a result of your killing him,
then you are obligated to get his original gear back, or help him upgrade from what
he had.
{w4){D Anything beyond level 30 is fair game, but for the slow learners of the realm,
have the patience to explain why you did what you did, if you are prompted to do so.
But do not feel you have to tolerate any sort of abuse from that player. Depending
on how that player acts, you might have to knock some sense into him.{x

0 10 sentinel relationships~
A listing of the various relationships with the various clans. Those clans not
mentioned are considered neutral, and therefore, are treated as an individual basis.
 
Ruler - While their intentions are good, their laws tend to get in the way from
making the right choices. As a general rule, being friends with them is a good idea,
and while acting according to their regulations while under their nose is oftentimes 
the best course of actions, it's not difficult to convince them to deputize the
members of Sentinel to have the ability to legally break the laws. If WANTED, the
best course of action is escape. Do NOT attack the Ruler clan hall in retaliation.
 
Knight - Although they tend to look down their noses at us, they can be useful
allies. They, also, can be misguided, and when they have such an episode, it is best
to simply avoid them.
 
Scion - Kill them upon sight. Or lack thereof.
 
Shadow - Twist them to suit our purposes whenever possible. But be prepared to
take them out when necessary.
 
Barbarian, Chaos, Sylvan, Warlock - Individual case-by-case basis.
However, try not to cause interior termoil inside those clans. We do not wish to
see the clans themselves fall apart simply because you're the root of spats
between members. Everyone suffers, then, and that is something Sentinel doesn't
want.

0 8 SYLVAN duties~
{yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x Sisters & Brothers,

   While sleeping under a spruce tree in {RDying Forest{x the other
afternoon I was struck by a disconcerting vision.  In the vision I saw
{yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x old and new who were unsure about their duties as a {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x
Warden, and about the clan's disposition towards inhabitants of the
land.  So, do rid myself of this anxiety, and to ensure none of you
patrol with uncertainity of mind, I shall explain what you might missed
hearing in the excitement of your induction.

   Your main duty, as a {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x {gW{Garden{x, is to patrol our {gForests{x.  You
should keep an eye out for poachers and perversions of nature.  How you
deal with these things is mostly up to you.  But I will offer my
recommendations:

   When you encounter a {rpoacher{x, it is best to warn them that slaying
creatures of the {gForest{x is not permitted.  It is best to do this {Rloudly{x, 
so all the world can know a {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x is on duty and the Forests are safe
from harm.  If they do not heed your warning, or have already commited
crimes against the {gForest{x, then feel free to {rslay{x them.

   If you cannot slay them because the gods forbid it, or because they
are significantly your greater in combat, do your best to annoy them
until they leave.  This can be done by summoning the {YP{yollen{x of the
Forest to excite their allergies.  Pelting them with arrows or other
aggression of distance will encourage them to leave as well.  You may
also contact the {WS{wh{Dad{wo{Ww{x Stalker clan, and offer a bounty for the head of
the poacher.  Prices are usually {Ylevel * 100{x.  So a poacher of the 30th
rank would be a {Y3,000 gold{x {gbounty{x.  Do not worry about the money, there
is much in the {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x coffers.  I will pay all clan debts, or re-inburse
you.

   {DPerversions of Nature{x are another matter entirely.  If you see an
{DUgly{x, or someone leading an {DUndead{x army through the {gForest{x you are to 
slay them on sight, if possible.  They are, under no circumstances, to
be allow to walk freely through the Forest.  They disrupt the cycle of
life, and frighten the animals.

   If you suspect someone is not a {Bhabitual ally{x of the {Dundead{x then you
may just ask them to leave immediately.  If they do not heed your
commands then you should slay them or treat them the same as the
poachers above.

   You are {Rnot{x to befriend, nor group with any {DPerversions of Nature{x, or 
those who regularly deal in perverting the natural course of things.
This means {DVampires{x, {DNecromancers{x and {DAnti-Paladins{x, all of whom
regularly disrupt the cycle of life by making the undead do their
bidding.

   While on {ypatrol{x you may refer to the {gForest{x as "{Gyour{x" {gForest{x.  The
Spirit of the Forest actually enjoyes this and considers it
protectiveness, rather than a statement of ownership.  You may do this
no matter what your rank in the clan.

   The {YP{yollen{x ability entrusted to us by the Great Tree is {Rnot{x to be
used for selfish reasons.  It is only to be used in defense of a {gForest{x,
when you are being attacked, or when you are attempting to slay a
perversion of nature.  You should not use the might of the Forest to
help you assassinate some Warrior who happens to be wandering through an
unprotected wooded area.

   {GCandidates{x for {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x membership are to be treated with respect and
offered help in the ways of equipment and battling foes.  They are {Rnot{x
to be coached on how to pass the tests I set before them.  They are {Rnot{x
to be given hints on the quests I set before them.  If they wish for
such they can always note me.

   {GDefense{x of the Sapling, the source of all {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x power and the health
of the Forest, is our primary concern.  Should the clan hall come under
attack, you should drop whatever you are doing and rush to its defense.
It doesn't matter that your arrows barely scratch the invaders, there is
always something to do.  You may snatch disarmed equipment, or generally
hastle the invaders however you can.  Healing defenders is always a good
idea as well.

   Okay, I think that covers it.  My hands are tired from chipping all
this into Medagar's bark.  If you have questions please send me a note
or ask me when you see me.

0 0 DRINKING ALCOHOL DRUNK~
The consumption of alcohol can have beneficial and detrimental affects
on your combat and other abilities.  How much it takes for you to get
drunk depends on your tolerance.  Those who are small in stature will 
be easily overcome by liquior.  Those who are large, or come from hearty
stock, such as dwarves, tend to take more to feel the effects of a good
drink.
 
Once you are drunk you may find it harder to hit your opponent, but the
wound you inflict will be much more deadly.  You'll also feel stronger
and a little more clumsy.
 
Mages will find it particularly hard to correctly enunciate their incantations
Those who channel their ki will will also have difficulty.  Clerics, though,
being drunk isn't exactly beneficial, have found it much easier to contact
their gods while drunk, than Mages do the Source.  And dwarven clerics are
well known for being able to manage both.
 
While you're drunk you'll also find that your opponent doesn't quite hit
as hard as you remember.

~
0 0 DRINKING SKILL~
The drinking skill is the ability to hold your liquior, and still maintain
your combat prowess.  As your drinking skills improve the detrimental
effects of being drunk will diminish.  However, you'll also notice that
it takes more drink to get drunk.
 
This skill cannot be taught, but can only be leaned one drink at a time.
The only school is a good pub.

0 0 SLAVERY~
Some people of the realm are known to be slavers, capturing and subjegating
people to their will instead of outright killing them.  In this way they
demonstrate their domination over the realm.
 
If you have been enslaved you should do your master's bidding, lest he
become dissatisified with you and slay you where you stand ({Da good RP reason
for another PK as per the RULES{x).
 
If you feel the life of slavery is too much of a hardship on your pride and
freedom, you may earn your freedom in one of three ways.
 
1) Convince your owner to release you from your bondage.
2) Slay your owner, or have him slain ({Dyou must both be in the realm at
the time of the slaying{x).
3) Commit suicide.
 
{DOOC: please note, when you are enslaved you do not lose CON, and you 
do not suffer exp penalities, nor samurai deaths.  If you commit suicide
your death will have the normal affect.{x

0 6 RULER conduct~
{WRuler Code of Conduct

{CIt should be remembered at all times that rulers serve the law and should
act in an appropriate way wether on patrol or undertaking personal business.

{W1.  Code on looting

 a) {wWhen acting as an officer of the law rules on looting are as follows:
    Non violent - no loot or loot gold only.                               
    Violent - loot gold or one item of value prefably the weapon.
    All looted items and gold should be clan donated for a period - then if  
    there is no error in judgement the items must be sacrificed.             

{W b) {wWhen acting in a personal matter you should remember that you still
    represent the ruler clan.  Full looting is frowned upon but is acceptable
    under extreme circumstances such as the person looted you or you are
    retrieving gear for another who they looted.  The final decision is left
    to the individual.

{W2.  Code on Killing those with souls (PK){w
    This is part of our world but any attempt by a member of ruler should have
    proper justification.  If you have no proper reason then you may not kill
    another soul. (you are only aloud to PK with A good RP reason.)  If the
    person is not a regular law breaker then you are not allowed to use your
    body guards.

{W3.  Bodyguards{w
    The use of bodyguards is a privilidge and should be treated as such.
    The life of a bodyguard is to be respected at all times and never used in  
    a manner that uselessly threatens it for self gain.  You may not use
    bodyguards for hunting creatures with greater souls (not to be used for PK)
    unless the person is a regular offender.

{W4.  Ruler equipment{w
    Ruler equipment is valuable and a privedlidge of office.  It cannot be
    left or lent to anybody.

{W5.  Judging of Criminals{w
    Every ruler should fill in the appropriate paperwork with every judgement
    and execution of criminals. (write a note to the clan)  This will allow
    others to comment on the ruling and help ensure consistancy in
    judgements.

{W6.  Activity{w
    Because by our presence crime can often be avoided all Rulers should
    attempt to be active.  {B(ooc as a means of measuring this all rulers should
    have 2 judgements a month.){w

0 8 SYLVAN application test~
Dear future {gLeaders{z and {gRecruitment Officers{z,

Since the application process is used to determine who might best serve the
{gForest{z, I thought I would offer you some insights into tests which I have
found best seperate the {Ywheat{x from the {ychaff{x.

In my tenure as Leader I usually performed the following, quite extensive
test.  There were many {Gcandidates{x who lost interest during the process,
and showed a lack of {ypatience{x, a {rvice{x not worthy of a {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x.  The tests
were constructed to identify such candidates and discourage them from
seeking admittance.  Those who passed all the tests set before them truely
deserved to wear the {gMark of the Wild {yEarth{x.

My applicants needed to pass all of the following:

{GApplication{x - all applicants were required to send a {rlengthy note{x to the clan
about their interest in guarding the Forest from poachers.  In this they
spoke of why the Forest meant so much to them and how they had come to
understand it.  They were to speak of their deeds in protecting the Forest
in their youth, and to the present day.  And they were to address their
commitment to the way of {yNature{x.

{GReputation{x - after receiving an application the {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x Wardens were asked
to watch the applicant and observe his or her {cpublic conduct{x.  The
applicant demonstrate their commiment to the {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x cause at this time. And
should develop a reputation for defending the Forest from harm.  Only when
the Venerable {gTrees{x of the Forest {rwhisper{x and {Rgossip{x about the new defender
will the applicant pass this part of the test.  I usually gave them a week
to develop a reputation as a champion of the Forest.  Those who are not
known throughout the land as a keeper of nature, should be encouraged to
seek another clan.

{GSeeking Home{x - after a reputation is earned, the applicant is asked to find
our Great Tree of Life and home.  The only clue that is traditionally given
to the applicant is, "{cWe live in a Forest untouched by man.{x"  No other clue
should be necessary.

{GConundrum{x - there is no greater virtue in the Forest than {Yresourcefulness{x.
And when defending the Forest against {rpoachers{x and {Dabominations of nature{x
often we find the gods prevent us from taking direct action.  Instead we
need to find other ways of protecting the Forest, or summoning its wrath.
Thus, when the applicant is at the clan hall, I ask them to meditate on
this common problem.  "{cIf you find a poacher in the Forest, who does not
heed your requests to leave, and yet the gods forsake you from directly
harming the poacher, what would you do?{x"  I ask them {Gnot{y to answer
immediately{x, but instead to {gmeditate{x on their answer while they complete
the other tests I set before them.

{GForest Lore{x - one of the more important virtues of being a {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x is knowing
the various Forest of the land.  To prove their ken, the applicant is tasked
with obtaining items from at least 3 different Forests.  Usually the items
can be found on the ground, and do not require slaying a foe to obtain.
Rarely would I even offer a clue on which Forests should be searched, as
all Forests should a {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x call home.  In my day these were among the
items I'd ask someone to retrieve:
{y  blue-capped mushroom     - Emerald Forest
  three-eyed root          - Emerald /Witch Forest (Dead Moors)
  blue furry plant         - Virgin Forest
  trout                    - Virgin Forest
  camouflaged gloves       - Magic Forest
  smokey grey rose         - Magic Forest
  barrel of Dorwinion wine - Mirkwood
  spice jar                - Holy Grove
  dusk of black gyvel      - Grassy Plains{x

{GMettle{x - testing an applicant's mettle can be difficult.  It's best to tailor
the test to play against the strengths of the applicant and into their
weakness.  I usually task the applicant with slaying some creature who
threatens our land, or a poacher who has become bothersome.  The creature
is often of significantly greater power than the applicant (usually {r20{x levels
or more).  And when the applicant is a ranger, I usually give them an even
greater foe, as often monsters love to walk right into arrows.  Here is a
list, with approximate difficulty:

{y  85 Yllias              - Divided Souls  - Shadow's Edge
  80 Reykas              - Divided Souls  - shadow talons
  75 Myzelak the Lich    - Lich Tower     - Hell's Wrath
  70 Nightmare           - Divided Souls  - nightmare's eye (acid immune)
  70 vampire janitor     - Divided Souls  - vampire fangs
  68 Bloody Sadist       - Divided Souls
  65 Cultist High Priest - Divided Souls  - blood drenched dagger
  65 Lord Krothgar       - Mount Doom     - sword of Lord Krothgar
  60 Medagar (tree)      - Dying Forest   - ebonwood bark
  60 shadow dragon       - Magical Forest
  59 Lethrak (naga)      - Dying Forest
  58 Rimlarker (juggernaut) - Dying Forest
  57 Metagar (elemental) - Dying Forest   - elemental fist
  55 Belqark (vines)     - Dying Forest
  52 yellow warlock      - Magical Forest - golden eye sword
  50 anti-ranger         - Dying Forest   - blackend bastard sword
  48 red warlock         - Magical Forest - oaken staff
  43 Demon-Elf           - Emerald Forest - green serpent-tressed wig
  40 greater naga        - Dying Forest
  40 Witch Hela          - Emerald Forest - Ikon of Sebastian
  40 Kostchtchie         - Yggdrasil      - huge hammer of cold iron
  35 dark stalker        - Dying Forest
  35 devil's huntsman    - Emerald Forest - Hell-Blade{x

{GIntimacy{x - the last, and {gfinal test{x (besides the resourcefulness conundrum)
is to have the applicant discover the {Ysecret{x of the Virgin Forest.  When they
feel confident enough with the path through the forest, I invite them to
{grace{x me to one of the exits.  I haven't been beaten yet, though that is not
important.  What is important is that they do not get {rlost{x.  Nothing more
embarassing than a {yS{gy{Glv{ga{yn{x lost in their own forest.

{yRemember{x to have them answer the conumdrum, and should you find the answer
worthy, welcome into the fold.

These are of course, only suggestions, and you may conduct whatever tests you
wish.  But I have found these to ferret out the {gb{Ges{gt{x candidates.

When you commune or channel clairvoyance the creatures of the forest lend
their senses to you for a moment.  In this way you might be able to
detect an interloper or poacher in a distant tree-line.  Unfortunately,
many creatures of the forest do not poses your attuned senses, and thus
can only mention if they feel Someone is nearby.

Because the gods for some reason choose to protect many of the poachers
and aboninations of nature who enter the Forest, the Trees have granted
the Sylvan Wardens the ability to excite the allergies of these interlopers
in hopes of irritating them enough to make them leave.  When someone's
allergies are excited their eyes will occationally swell and leave them
blind for a short time.  Or they might be overcome with drowsyness and
sleep for a moment.  The itching is often so bad they cannot mask their
presence either.  All the affects only last as long as the person remains
in the Forest.  Should they leave all symtoms disappear.
 
{DNote: this is a very powerful ability and ignores PK range.  It must
only be used to perform your Sylvan RP duty.  It should not be used just
to PK whomever you wish.  If that becomes common, this ability will be
severly nerfed.  It is only so powerful to give Sylvan a way to patrol
outside of their PK range.{x

0 0 MULTIKILLER~
Many of the ole timers here are still pining for the good ole days when 
there was no MultiKill rule, and you could just beat each other senseless
for hours on end without troubling yourself over creating a new RP reason.

In that vein, we timidly bring you the {rmultikiller{x toggle.  Well, not
really a toggle, because you {rCANNOT{c turn it {rOFF{x.  Once you set
the Multikiller flag, it is set for life.  Don't even try to ask the
immortals to remove your flag.  Impossible.

So, what does activating the MultiKiller flag get you?  Well, it means that
any {rtwo{x people who {rboth{x have the multikiller flag set can ignore
the Multikill rule with each other.  They can kill each other until CON
deletion, if they want -- all in one day, if they're really head strong.

So, here are the rules (just to be clear):

If you are a {rmultikiller{x and your victim is not, you {RMUST{x abide by
the {CMULTIKILL{x rules.

If you are {rnot{x a multikiller, and your victim is a {rmultikiller{x you
{RMUST{x abide by the {CMULTIKILL{x rules.
But!

If you are a {rmultikiller{x and your victim is a {rmultikiller{x then you
can {RIGNORE{x the {CMULTIKILL{x rules and just keep slaying each other.
(though it would be nice if you gave the other guy a chance to equip or

0 0 NEWBIE HELPER~
Newbies, or those who are new to the realm can either seek general help
via the {MNewbie{x channel, or help from a specific player who has their
{mN{Mewbie {mH{Melper{x flag toggled (as is visible on the WHO list).
 
These Helpers will offer you assistance Out of Character.  That is, even if
they are evil, or part of a clan that promotes confusion, while they have
this flag on, they will be of the best assistance to you.
 
If you are an experienced player and wish to turn on the {mN{Mewbie {mH{Melper{x
flag, type {CTOG HELPER{x.  While this flag is active you {rMUST NOT{x engage
in offensive PvP actions, including PK.  However, toggling this flag does not
make you immune to PKing.
 
We do ask all players to {rRESPECT{x when a Newbie Helper is {rACTIVELY{x
assisting a newbie, and to please {rNOT{x PK them while they are doing so.
If they are just idle with the flag set, and clearly not helping anyone you
may feel free to slay them without remorse.
 
Do {rNOT{x abuse this feature.  Anyone caught using the Newbie Helper flag to
lull a victim into a false sense of security will be punished {rHARSHLY{x.
Anyone found being mean or deceiving Newbies while they have this flag on
will be be shown no mercy.

0 5 BARBARIAN leadership~
{WChallenge of a Leader{x
 
A Leader of Barbarian is the one who serves the purpose of channeling
tasks given by immortals to their Champions to other Barbarians, He/She
is the one who plans the attack on enemies and the one responsible for
prosperity and health of the clan. If one wants to challenge current
leader, he/she needs to earn support of immortals, the patron immortal
first of all. But besides being favored by gods, being Leader requires
skills to deal with mortals. In case if Leader steps down willingly
he/she has to name of the new Leader and if the named person gains the
approval of immortals, he/she becomes the new Barbarian Chief. If a
challenger arises and the current Leader is unwilling to pass the
leadership, the challenger should gain immortal support and support of
at least 1/3 of members of Barbarian to make the challenge official.
After the challenge is made official, both Leader and Challenger have
last chance to step down or renounce claims, if they dont, then they
have to fight in the presence of immortal, and the one who wins a match
till 3 wins becomes new Leader, the loser becomes second in the clan,
since he had enough support among members and immortals to be one, but
loses any chance to ever become a Leader. So unless you are assured in
your victory dont challenge. If the challenger gains support of 1/2
members, then he/she becomes a new Leader without any duels.

0 5 BARBARIAN code~
{W Code of Barbarians{x
 
Barbarians are sworn to destroy the users of 'stolen magic'. Those who
use it are sentenced to death by us. This should be cleared out.  Long
time ago magic was monopoly of immortals, gods who created this world
and filled it with numerous wonders and creatures. But some mortals have
{rStolen {xthe secret of magic from gods, they opened guilds and teached
others this secret that does not belong to mortals. Gods tried to
destroy them, but heretics using arts of magic they learned managed to
escape holy wrath. So Gods called for those mortals who denied magic,
those who wanted to bring thieves to justice, since mortal heretics were
to be slayed by mortal Champions. That is the day our clan originates
from.
As well as our glorious ancestors we deny foul magic and for this, we
are granted our powers. Our primary targets are
warlocks,witches,necromancers,vampires and anti-paladins- since they
dedicated their whole life to studying 'magic' and there is no way to
cure them of blasphemy, but any person who uses magic , be it a
pill,potion,scroll or any other item that contains a curse of magic, is
commiting profanity. Such individuals are to be warned to avoid
insulting Barbarian by using magic, and if they ignore warning, they are
to be slayed, since their soul is tainted by magic. There is no excuse
for Barbarian to use magic items, though we dont necessarily destroy
them promptly- it is better to know your enemies and what they use to
strike them better. Learn the nature of magic item to know what expect
from magic users and be prepared. Due to our denial to use magic we are
rumoured to be stupid beasts, we know that it is nothing but lies ,
spread by heretics, but this lie can serve us- let our opponents
underestimate us. When your opponent is slain, feel free to loot money
from the corpse, Barbarian may also destroy a couple of cursed magic
items,but leaving fallen enemy without equipment is low behaviour and is
strongly unappreciated, unless there were reasons for full loot.

The repudiate command is used to commit yourself to reject the gods and
commit your life to the way of atheism.  This is a one-way decision, as
no god will accept your worship after you reject the pantheon.
 
To become an atheist you must first scratch off your tattoo, if you have
one.  And then 'repudiate <god>' where <god> is the name of your chosen
diety.  If you are currently agnostic, and have never chosen a god to 
worship, then you can 'repudiate gods'.

NEWBIE PROTECTION
 
A newbie account is offered to let new player experience our realm in
a newbie-friendly way.  Our realm has a pretty significant learning
curve when it comes to PK (Player Killing) and by choosing a newbie
account you are offered immunity from PK.

Features of the Newbie Account:
   * Other players will go out of their way to help you (even if this
     violates their normal roleplay).
   * Immune to PK.
   * quest items are at 1/3 the cost.

Restrictions of the Account:
   * {rmax level 40{x (at which point hopefully you've learned enough
     to remake and 'do it right')
   * cannot PK
   * cannot join a clan
   * cannot cast spells on people outside your group
   * cannot hold artifacts (limited items)

This account is meant for new players, not veterans.  Any veterans using
newbie accounts for more than just testing will be punished.

rival the heavens themselves.  Those whose power is born from the
{CS{Wo{Mur{wc{Ce{x, {mE{Ml{wi{Wd{wo{Md{mi{x could be considered the most ambitious of all. These
mages have dedicated their lives to breeching the door of the vault

whether in hopes of world domination, world peace or their own desired
ends.

Many might refer to these mages as atheists, but nothing could be

By creating new and unique forms of {mA{Mr{Yca{Wna{x and manipulating the {CS{Wo{Mur{wc{Ce{x

   MPCODES -----------------------------------------------------------------
   * MPCodes allow your mobs to do programable tasks to help interface
   with players in a unique way.  These are often rather time-consuming
   for the builders to create.  Not all builders know how to create them.
   
   - The cost of the MPCode will be decided based on how complex the code
   needs to be, and how long it takes the builder to get it working.
   - The cost is per MPCode and another cost is added for each mob that
   triggers this code.
   - MPCode are intended to create interesting interactions, and will not
   be created to gain PK advantage, nor PK semi-immunity.
   - No mob_progs (special server code) will be written for your house.

                correcting errors, it will cost you anywhere from
                300qp to the full price of a new MPCode depending on
                the extent of the change.

   GENERAL NOTES---------------------------------------------------------

   * You cannot have more object or mobs than you have purchased rooms

   * Your house will remain after your deletion.

   * If your character is deleted for any reason (30day, CON etc) your
   house becomes "Abandoned".  You cannot re-create and reclaim your house.
   If you know you'll be on holiday, you may make a formal request BEFORE
   your holiday starts to have your pfile saved until a definate date.

   * Abandoned houses may be modified by the builders to create an area
   interesting for players to explore and pillage.  The original intent
   and concept of the house (including almost all descriptions) will
   remain as the owner meant them.

   * All color code information must be presented to the builder in a way
   that s/he can cut and paste your text to get the correct colors.  This
   is done by having the {{ show up in the text presented to the builder.
   If you are sending your plans via email there shouldn't be a problem.
   If you are sending them via notes then you'll need to use {{{{ to make
   sure the symbol shows up when writing your note.

   * Other than correcting typos and other errors with your house caused
   by the builder, you will be charged from 25k gold for each request.
   This is mostly to stop people from bugging their builder all the time
   with little requests, rather than saving them up and lumping them 
   together in one big request.

   * Houses that existed before this document was created will be
   modified to be w/in the constraints of this document.  Mobs,
   including the guard mob(s) will be set to about 75% of their max
   possible strength in reference to upgrades.

   * The builder's primary duties are to the Mud in general, not your
   house in specific.  And thus building your house comes second to any
   other duties the builder might have.

   * Having a house is a privilege, not a right.

    Even in fights.  Especially during fights.

{D[{r-{D] {WDon't sleep, hang around or go AFK at MSM.{x
    Don't go AFK anywhere someone can easily find you.
    Log out, if you can.

{D[{r-{D] {WFind a safe place to sleep.{x
    Your guild is good, your clan is better.
    Never in Midgaard, or an area where you level.

{D[{r-{D] {WKeep your 'see invisible' affect refreshed.{x
    You'd be surprised how easy it is for a samurai to sneak
    up on you when you're missing this simple incantation.

2. {D<{w<{W< {rPrepare {W>{w>{D>{x
Attackers are always at the advantage because they are fully
prepared for battle, fully spelled up, fully equipped.

{D[{r-{D] {WLook at good players to find what eq is good.{x
    Buy it from a Shadow -- it's worth the price.

{D[{r-{D] {WKeep your spells up.{x
    Q: What do you call a cleric without sanctuary?

    It's easy to cut trees down because they just stand there.

92 0 ifrand if rand~
Sytax: if rand [{Gwhole number{z]
Exa. : if rand {G50{z
              
If rand makes the mud 'roll a dice' to check if
the number is equal to or greater than the 
{Gwhole number{x provided. So if you choose {G1{x
as your {Gwhole number{x. Then you would have no
chance of failure.
      
Why? Simple. The mud would roll a number from 1 to
100 and since you chose {G1{x as your {Gwhole number{z
then there is no chance of it not being 1 or greater.
The same goes for 100. If you choose {G100{x as your 
number than you only have a 1 in 100 chance of success,
making the likely hood of success highly improbable.
         
There are only 2 ways to use this if check. 
              
one) by itself: if rand 50
                say 50 or more!
                endif
                end
                    
two) with else: if rand 50
                say 50 or more!
                else 
                say less than 50!
                endif
                end
              
Of course you may use it with other checks. But to
keep this short I will only give 1 example.
                  
            if rand 50
            and name $n Daphais
            say Hello Daphais
            else
            say Hello
            endif
            end
The mud would 'roll' it's number then if it was
equal to or above 50 then it would check to see if
the target (the pc/npc who initiated the prog) is 
named Daphais. If so it would say "Hello Daphais".
If the target wasn't named Daphais or if the muds 
'roll' was less than 50 it would simply say "Hello"

0 2 Shadow Cloak~
Living a life in the perifery of society has given the Shadow stalker an
Intimate knowledge of the darkness.  So much that they can enshroud themselves
With a cloak of shadows that makes it harder for enemy to hit them.
~
0 2 hunt~
It's often been said that the hardest part of a hit is finding the mark.  The
Shadow Stalker elders, therefore, developed a way to track a mark no matter
Where he might hide.  When first learned a mark can only be hunted if his
Location has already been narrowed down to a particular forest, or city.
~
0 2 Find Object~
The Shadow Stalkers have long had a reputation as a people who know how to
Get things.  Every member of the clan seems to possess a 6th sense on who
Might be walking around with what, and where a certain lost heirloom might
Be found laying on the ground.  This 6th sense is even better than the mages
Have been able to muster.
~
0 2 Phantasm~
When on a stakeout, waiting for a mark to leave the safty of the guildhall,
It's often good to have someone to talk to, someone to share the time with.
The Shadow Stalkers have been blessed the ability to conjure phantasms from
The shadows.  These beings, though not great conversationalists, will assist
In combat, and are good for knocking down doors.
~
0 2 Take Revenge~
Though it is rare, occationally a Shadow Stalker is bested in combat.  When
This happens it is always prudent to return to the scene of death and recover
Belongings so that they do not fall in your enemy's hands.  When you take
Revenge you are instantly transported to your corpse.
~
0 2 Armor Use~
Before sending Shadow Stalkers out to their first job, each on is instructed
On a special way to handle their armor for maximium effect.  When this skill
Succeeds, the individual is harder to hit.  The more proficient the Shadow
Stalker in combat, the better the protection.

      for the builders to create.  Not all builders know how to create them.
    
    - The cost of the MPCode will be decided based on how complex the code
      needs to be, and how long it takes the builder to get it working.
    - The cost is per MPCode and another cost is added for each mob that
      triggers this code.
    - MPCode are intended to create interesting interactions, and will not
      be created to gain PK advantage, nor PK semi-immunity.

0 0 'HOUSES GENERAL NOTES'~
GENERAL NOTES---------------------------------------------------------
 
    * You cannot have more object or mobs than you have purchased rooms
 
    * Your house will remain after your deletion.
 
    * If your character is deleted for any reason (30day, CON etc) your
      house becomes "Abandoned".  You cannot re-create and reclaim your house.
      If you know you'll be on holiday, you may make a formal request BEFORE
      your holiday starts to have your pfile saved until a definate date.
 
    * Abandoned houses may be modified by the builders to create an area
      interesting for players to explore and pillage.  The original intent
      and concept of the house (including almost all descriptions) will
      remain as the owner meant them.
 
    * All color code information must be presented to the builder in a way
      that s/he can cut and paste your text to get the correct colors.  This
      is done by having the { show up in the text presented to the builder.
      If you are sending your plans via email there shouldn't be a problem.
      If you are sending them via notes then you'll need to use {{ to make
      sure the symbol shows up when writing your note.
 
    * Other than correcting typos and other errors with your house caused
      by the builder, you will be charged from 25k gold for each request.
      This is mostly to stop people from bugging their builder all the time
      with little requests, rather than saving them up and lumping them 
      together in one big request.
 
    * Houses that existed before this document was created will be
      modified to be w/in the constraints of this document.  Mobs,
      including the guard mob(s) will be set to about 75% of their max
      possible strength in reference to upgrades.
 
    * The builder's primary duties are to the Mud in general, not your
      house in specific.  And thus building your house comes second to any
      other duties the builder might have.
 
    * Having a house is a privilege, not a right.

About half the height of a human being, and a quarter of the weight,

exaggerated facial features.  They are prone to exaggerated emotional states
and emotional outbursts, whether happy, sad, hungry, or sleepy.  Once one is
set in his ways, it's very difficult to change his mind.

0 0 'HALF-ORCS' HALFORCS~
Half-Orcs typically lead one of three lives.  The first choice is to live
amongst humans and be constantly degraded due to being considered ugly,
stupid, and dangerous to be around.  The second is to live amongst orcs, and
to be degraded due to being weak, not as ugly.  The third is to live
solitarily, void of racial companionship.  
Half-Orcs typically look like humans, except taller, broader-shouldered,
and brutish-looking, with pronounced bone structure in the face, as well
as visible tusks protruding from their mouths.

0 0 'WOOD-ELF' 'WOOD-ELVES' WOODELF WOODELVES~
Wood-Elves are the above-ground cousins of Rockseer.  Unlike Elves and
Drow, Wood-Elves share an acute attenuation with nature, and live in tribes.
The tribes themselves live a variety of housing arrangements, whether it be
high in the trees, in beaver-like dams on the water, or tent-like structures
that're easily replaced.  Wood-Elves consistently have earthier tones than
their cousins, skin bronzed by the sun, with hair ranging from copper red to
chestnut brown.

0 0 ARENA~
Arenas are places of combat where the rules of mortality do not apply.
Combat is finished without true death.  When you die in combat you do
not lose EXP, nor do you lose CON points, nor gain Samurai deaths. 
 
Arena rooms are indicated by [{YA{x].
 
They are not OOC rooms, though you are allowed to treat them as such if
you'd like to practice against an enemy.
 
Also, this only applies to PvP death, not death to non-pet mobs.

0 0 CONSUME DEAD~
With this mystical power you command your undead minions to devour
a recently fallen corpse and replenish themselves with the soul within.
 
Syntax: cast 'consume dead' corpse

0 0 'GAMBLING WAGER' GAMBLE WAGER~
Often a way to pass the time, or get rich quick, gambling is a way of 
life for many in the realm.  If you are so inclined, then seek out
a professional to win some gold off of.
 
Gambling works in stages.  First you need to select your game:
          wager shell
to play the shell game.
 
Then put some money down.
          wager 20 gold

Then play the game (for example in the shell game, pick a shell)
          wager left
 
{C(All game commands are done through 'wager'){x
 
If you log out, or need to quit gambling for some reason you can always:
          wager forefeit
 
There are modifiers in place, but what they are I'm not telling. {Y:){x
 
Enjoy, and GOOD LUCK!
