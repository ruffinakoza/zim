A dark man stands in the tent, uttering strange words of binding.
~
Despite living in the middle of a desert, this man is clothed entirely in
black, his face uncovered but his hair hidden by cloth wound around his
head.  He appears to be middle aged; his short pointed beard is graying,
though few lines mar his face.  His lips seem to be curled into a permanent
sneer, and there is something dark and hideous hidden in the depths of his
eyes.

An immense being rages here, trapped in a circle of dark sand.
~
Pacing along the edge of the circle that binds it, the demon occasionally
lets out a loud roar of displeasure, its eyes filled with a burning desire
to destroy everything around it.  Its skin is red and leathery, covered with
scars as if it has seen countless battles.  Thick, black horns jut out from
its head, curving upward and topped with a strange liquid that almost seems
to glow.  Its most distinguished feature is its eyes, large and filled with
an intense hatred desperate to be set free.

Inside the Princess' Tent~
The air is blessedly cool here inside the tent.  Pillows are strewn all
about the interior, dyed in vibrant reds, blues and purples.  Several
porcelain dishes are placed on a stand by the western wall of the tent, but
only crumbs remain of whatever food they once held.  The tent extends to the
north, which is separated from the entrance by a shimmering silk curtain.

Inside the Princess' Tent~
Pillows have been placed at the tent's northeastern corner, carefully
arranged to form a bed.  Fine silks and ivory carvings are strewn about the
tent, almost carelessly, as if the inhabitant sees little value in them. 
The air is cool here, a welcome break from the unrelenting heat of the
desert outside.  A shimmering silk curtain separates this section of the
tent from the entrance to the south.

Inside the Vizier's Tent~
The tent's interior is quite dark.  Only a few black candles provide
light, which is barely adequate to keep you from tripping over the books and
unidentifiable mounds stewn all about.  The air here is cold, enough that it
seems unnatural.  It is as if the tent is in the middle of some frigid
wasteland, rather than a blistering desert.  The tent extends to the north,
where candles have been arranged in a circle, revealing a macabre scene.  
~

E
books mounds~
Books and unidentifiable mounds cover the tent floor.  Some of the tomes
appear to be quite thick, bearing disturbing images of demon faces that seem
as though they would only belong in the worst of nightmares.

A few black candles of various sizes have been placed around the tent to
provide light, strange runes running down along their length.

Inside the Vizier's Tent~
Dozens of black candles have been carefully arranged and placed just
outside a circle of black sand.  The candles seem to be giving off less
light than they should, as if the darkness around them is feeding on it. 
The air here is frigid, and musty, filled with the scent of death.  A
malevolent presence seems to be contained in the circle, growing stronger as
you approach.

The sand is pitch black, and doesn't seem to come from the desert.

Tall, flickering candles surround a circle of black sand, barely

A few candles bring light to the southern half of the tent, though barely
enough to spot the mounds of books that seem to be scattered about.

Inside the Chief's Tent~
Weapons and trophies adorn the nomad chief's tent, evidence of his
success against his enemies in past conflicts.  The furniture in the tent
appears to be purely functional, showing little sign of the wealth that he
obviously possesses.  A large table of dark, hard wood is at the center of
the tent, covered with scrolls and blank parchment, with an ink jar just to
the side.  At the far northeastern corner of the tent is the bed where the
chief sleeps, really nothing more than a collection of pillows arranged in a
pile.  
~

E
furniture~
The table is made of dark wood, strange animals carved along its edge. 
Most of the scrolls are covered in an unrecognizable script; the rest are
blank.  The ink jar is only half full, with a box of sand next to it to help
it dry faster.

Curved swords and daggers decorate the tent, trophies from the chief's
fallen enemies.

Steam Tent~
The steam tent is bare of any decorations or furniture.  The only notable
feature is a small pit for fire, and a pail for water placed next to it. 
This tent has been designed to keep in the steam from the flames and water,
allowing the nomads to bathe and relax in a land where water is too rare to
use for anything but drinking.  The ground here is cracked and dry, though
thankfully not as hot here away from the sun.

#19556
The Warriors' Tent~
The warriors' tent is fairly large, among the biggest in the camp.  It
mainly serves as a meeting and resting place for the warriors among the
nomads, who live separately from the others.  The far north end is where the
warriors sleep, on rolls that look as though they could barely provide any
comfort.  The rest of the tent has a carpeted floor, where the warriors sit
to have thier meals and share a laugh with their comrades.  
~

rolls~
The rolls are thin and lumpy, hardly any better than the ground to sleep on.

#19557
The Supply Tent~
The supply tent is filled with crates, some of them left carelessly open.
Most appear to contain food; dried meats and vegetables, flasks of wine and
water.  Some appear to hold goods bought from the passing caravans, or
crafts that the nomads themselves intend to trade.  At first glance, it
doesn't appear as though they hold anything of much worth.

By the Camels~
Tents are spread out to the east, where several hundred nomads have set
up camp.  Though nomad warriors walk past you, they hardly spare you a
glance, accustomed to outsiders and confident in their numbers.  This area
seems to be used to keep the camels, of which there are over two dozen. 
They are tied up next to posts thrust firmly into the ground, grazing on the
hard, dry grass growing out of the cracked earth.  Voices from the nomad
camp drift up here every now and then, men and women calling out to each
other.

Among the Tents~
Tents are spread out throughout the camp, seemingly erected wherever a
convenient spot could be found, with little attention payed to organization.
Sentries are placed at the edge of the camp, hands on their sword hilts and
watching the desert for any signs of danger.  People move about the camp,
going about their daily tasks.  The smell of camels is thick in the air, and
every now and again a nomad leads one through the camp, bearing supplies in
preparation for a trip.

evaporates almost as fast as it appears, and it seems that no amount of

walk, it always seems to stay as distant as ever.  The sand dunes continue

There is a pool of clear blue water here, reflecting the cloudless sky. 
The water appears to be quite deep, welling up from a hidden source far
underground.  A few flowers with bright red petals bloom next to the pool,
all the more beautiful for the barren landscape around them.  The desert
heat here is intense, though the water feels strangely cool to the touch,
instantly refreshing.

{yBefore a Wall of Stone{x~
A tall wall of rock rises up out of the ground, its stone sand-coloured
and uneven.  The wall rises up about a hundred feet into the air, and seems
to be roughly circular in shape, ending in a sharp point and standing out
distinctly against the desert sky.  The stone at the base of the wall has
been worn smooth by countless sandstorms, so that it is almost impossible to
find a grip along its length.  Higher up, there seem to be several ledges,
one of which leads up to a large opening, though it is difficult to make out
any more than that from this vantage point.

Tall sand dunes spread before you, seeming like an ocean of sand, with
waves shifting as a soft desert wind blows across them.  The slight breeze
brings no relief from the relentless sun, carrying hot desert air across the
dunes to assault you.  The desert spreads in every direction, seemingly
without end, and everywhere you turn seems to look exactly the same, endless
waves of sand with no signs of civilization.

A caravan has stopped here in the shade between two particularly large

up in rolls, and large casks and crates strapped to their backs, whose
contents are hidden from sight.  Most of the camels are resting by the side
of the road, their burdens removed for the moment.  People move about the
caravan, checking on their goods and ensuring that everything is in order.

Tracks across the sand show that several people have recently traveled
along this trail, though a soft wind has blown sand over many of them and
eliminated any trace.  The dunes to either side of the path provide some
shade, though it is fairly inconsistent, the harsh sun's rays breaking throw
in several places where the dunes lie too low to block it.  The trail winds
its way eastward around a small dune, and continues to the west as well.  A
few people seem to have wandered ahead of the caravan to the west, and are
resting on the side of the trail.

An almost overpowering stench fills the cave, smelling of rotting
carcasses and things better left unmentioned.  Light filters in from the
entrance, and the remnants of the strong wind outside flow through the
opening, though the breezes are not enough to dispel any part of the
unpleasant odor.  The cave appears to be quite large, much bigger than it
appears from outside, with the far end lost in darkness.  It appears as
though something very large makes its home in this cave.

Sand dunes rise on either side of the trail, tall enough to block out the
sun and provide some much-needed shade.  A light breeze shifts the dunes
above, causing sand to trickle down the slope and collect along the side of
the trail.  Footprints can be seen along the path, where the sand hasn't
covered them up, showing that this road has been traveled through recently.

unnatural, mystical power seems to flow from its depths, dousing any light,
magical or natural.  The air here is startlingly cold, a sharp contrast to
the harsh desert heat just a few feet away.  Strange sounds come from the
darkness, impossible to identify, sometimes seeming as if they are just
ahead, other times sounding as though they are right behind you.  The path
ahead is completely black, not a single ray of light penetrating through the
darkness.

{cOn a Swaying Bridge{x~
An old, wooden bridge sways over a deep chasm, its bottom lost in
darkness.  Every sound you make echoes along the stone walls, almost
sounding mocking as it reaches your ears.  The bridge creaks and sways,
moved by a breeze that seems to come from nowhere.  To the west, an
unnatural darkness covers the passageway leading out of the caves, while to
the east the bridge leads to a large stone gate on solid ground.

{cAn Island over the Darkness{x~
A tall gate arches overhead, covered in ancient runes, half of which are
barely visible.  The ground beneath is solid, rising straight up out of the
chasm, made of hard, rough stone.  To the west a wooden bridge sways and
creaks, leading back towards a dark passageway, while to the east lies
another bridge, looking like it would barely be able to support a child's
weight.

{cA Decaying Bridge{x~
This wooden rope bridge looks very old, and it creaks unsteadily as the
wind from below sways it back and forth.  Several planks are missing
completely, long since fallen into the inky darkness below, and many of
those that are remaining seem to be loose.  To the east the bridge ends,
tied to two stone pillars standing right at the edge of an island of land
that rises up out of the chasm, while to the west another island stands
above the darkness, almost seeming to float from this perspective.

{cBefore the Magic Cave{x~
A large archway stands overhead, the stone carved to look like vines and
flowers, so delicate they almost seem real despite the lack of colour.  To
the west, a decaying bridge sways over a dark, seemingly endless chasm.  The
ground here is solid, and the air is warm, almost unpleasantly so.  Every
now and then, a breeze rises up, swaying the bridge and offering a moment's
relief from the heat.  To the east, a small passageway leads to a cavern
brightly lit with flickering torchlight.

{cInside the Magic Cave{x~
The small passageway opens up into a large, high-ceilinged cavern.  The
floor of the cavern is filled with countless piles of treasure, seemingly
strewn about at random.  Sparkling gems sit atop piles of gleaming gold
coins, next to crowns and scepters and riches enough to purchase and feed a
small kingdom.  Rolls of silk and finely dyed linens are piled together,
somehow still in perfect condition.  Tall chests lie about the cavern, some
open to reveal unimaginable riches, others closed tightly, hiding their
secrets within.  Ancient tomes and scrolls lie among the piles, excellently
preserved, though a loose page on the cavern floor shows that not all has
survived intact.

{W..but the warrior tried to take more than her share, thinking to
herself, '{CI'm the one who did all the work! I should get the reward.
I'm the one who discovered it, so it rightly belongs to me. The others
will just have to live without it!{W'.

  Reaching down, she grabbed everything she could find, fitting it all
in her backpack. Diamonds, gold, books, daggers...all sorts of things,
some of which she had no use for, but all she could think of was the
wealth that would be hers. She didn't notice the door slipping closed
behind her, or the ancient bones of the adventurers who had come before
her, too intent on grabbing all the most valuable treasure before anyone
else could get to it.

  No one even knew she had gone down to the caverns, because she hadn't
wished to reveal her secret to anyone, wanting all the treasures for
herself. No one was there to hear her screams.
 
Such is the price of greed.
