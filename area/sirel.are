him, the allure of ale and a warm meal has apparently been enough to bring
him here despite how uncomfortable he seems to be feeling now.  He is
dressed in warrior's attire, leather armor covering him from his feet to his
neck.  By his side rests an enormous bastard sword, though in his hands it
looks more like a shortsword.

startling blue eyes and a warm cheerful smile, and even the long white scar
across his left cheek does little to diminish his handsome features.  His
clothes are bright and colourful, though a bit dusty and worn, in a style
uncommon to this area, suggesting that he has traveled a long way.

Through the Mountain Pass~
The cobblestone road continues through the mountain pass, sharp peaks
blocking out the sun above.  Some of the road's ancient stones are sunken in
a little towards the edges, while others are cracked or sticking slightly up
in places, but aside from that it seems to be in relatively good condition. 
Tall boulders are lined up against the mountain wall to the east, as if they
have recently been cleared off the road.  To the north, the pass curves
slightly, blocking any view of what lies there, while to the south it leads
down back towards the city of Caerlon, its gleaming walls visible in the
distance.

A small wooden gate stands at the mouth of the mountain pass, guarding
the entrance to the quaint little village to the north, though in truth with
Caerlon so close by, the villagers have little need of it.  The cobblestone
road here is better kept than it is to the south, a sign of its frequent
use.  The gates are open, and just wide enough for a wagon or cart to pass
through.  To the north the road continues, making its way past the modest
homes of the villagers, all the way up to a larger building whose tiles
glitter in the light.

The steady sound of metal striking metal fills the street here, coming

such place in the entire village.  A merchant's wagon is stopped before the
shop, half-loaded with goods brought to the village for trade.  Men and
women occassionaly walk past you down the road, heading towards their fields
to do farm work or going out to gather firewood.  The village's atmosphere
is calm and peaceful, and every passing villager greets you with an open
smile.

The Smithy~
The smithy really only consists of one long stone wall which holds a
forge and hooks for the blacksmith's implements.  A roof supported by
several columns stands over it all, blocking out the sun and keeping the
smithy safe from the elements.  Several barrels filled with treated water
are placed by the anvil, and several finished works have been left on a
wooden bench off to the side.

A small door set into the eastern wall leads into a tiny room, where the
store owner does his calculations.  The shopkeeper is normally found behind
the counter placed by the back door, ready to do business with the villagers
and the merchants who come to Sirel to trade.

closed.  The kitchen is small, but wide enough to fit a decent-sized oak

The mayor's library is rather humble, though it houses more books than
all the homes of the villagers combined.  Most appear to be adventure
stories, along with a few religious texts, though those are for the most
part restricted to tales of the miraculous deeds of gods and priests.  A
leather armchair is placed against the southern wall, just beneath a wide
window that allows a lovely view of the trees and flowers in the fields just
outside.  A weathered book has been left on the chair, the cover so worn
with age that the title has been lost.

{DThe Order of Talath lost its main temple in the town of Sirel when it
was overrun by orcs in the Month of Winter, ca. 566 by the Shalin Calendar.
Although some of the townsfolk stayed to rebuild their homes amidst the
devestation, the majority of the town's inhabitants settled in the village
of Caerlon, which had begun construction of stone walls to defend against
further attacks.
 
The Order lost a great number of its Knights in the attack, and was never
able to fully recover. The temple at Sirel was never rebuilt, and its
former champions found themselves scattered and isolated across the realm,
fighting desperately to turn the tide of the war. Although the orcs were
soon defeated, the Order of Talath had been dealt a mortal blow and lost
its influence over the land, eventually disappearing altogether.
 
What became of the mysterious leader of the horde as well as the
treasures presumably looted from the temple has never been discovered,
though many theories abound.

By the Well~
The village well stands here, a stone structure with a wooden roof and a
large pail attached to a rope and pulley.  The stones are slick with water,
fresh and cool from a deep underground source.  This ancient well provides
pure, clean water for the villagers, of which they are blessed with an
abundance.  The bottom of the well seems to be just out of sight, though
something glitters at the bottom.

At the Bottom of the Well~
The air here at the floor of the well is winter cold, and it's not helped
by the icey water at its bottom.  You stand along the edge of the well,
where the water is only three feet deep.  Towards the center, the stone
ground suddenly gives way and there's no telling how deep the black depths
of the water lie.  The large metal pail that the villagers use to pull up
water is completely submerged, though you can see the rope connected to it
rise up out of the water towards the opening of the well and the bright sky
above.  At the eastern edge of the wall, a small alcove seems to have been
dug into the wall, the stones removed and the dark hard earth burrowed into.
Gold coins and gems glitter as your light hits them, stashed into the small

waterfall pouring out of the mountains to the east.  To the north stands the

the ruins once were, it is quite obvious that at one time in its history
this island was not so overgrown.  The sounds of the stream can be heard

across this forest clearing, much of the stone buried deep into the earth,
or crushed to pieces and battered by the elements.  Vines and weeds grow
among the ruins, climbing the broken statues and threatening to pull down
the few scattered walls that remain standing.  The forest itself seems to be
slowly but surely encroaching on the ruins, threatening to swallow them up
completely.  Somehow, miraculously, a small altar rests among the ruins,
untouched.  Several fresh wildflowers have been left upon the altar, an
offering to unknown gods or spirits.

Matching tables and chairs of deep, red wood are placed about the common

every variety of plant that can be found near the village has been recorded.

 
{WAlodil's Tears{x
{GThis lovely blue flower is found only in Sirel. It must be in close
proximity to water to thrive, and does especially well in forests. The
locals claim it has special curative properties, specifically in regards
to poison, but my experiments have not found them effective against the
more common varieties of poison, and I have been unable to confirm their
claims. The flower has traditionally been used as an offering to
the gods, and is often present in religious ceremonies.
 
The flower has blue petals, with a strong, thornless stem, which typically
grows up to five leaves in addition to the petals. The scent is pleasant
but weak, somewhat similar to vanilla.
 
{WBlue Bell-Flowers{G
This variety of the bell-flower, common to mountain regions, grows to
approximately six inches in height. It is known for its sweet scent
and vibrant blue colour, and it is traditionally woven into a garland
to be worn in a bride's hair in traditional village weddings.
 
When ingested, the flower has been known to give a boost of energy,
though the blindness that often accompanies it has long dissuaded the
curious from experimenting with these properties.

it is opened or closed, but aside from that, this room seems to be well
kept.

The Innkeeper's Daughter's Room~
Sunlight spills through the window, golden rays illuminating a floor
littered with toys and dolls.  A small bed is pushed up against the wall
beneath the window, sized for a child.  A shelf on the western wall holds
still more dolls, carefully arranged to face outward, as if keeping watch
over the room.  A tall mirror stands opposite the shelf on the eastern wall,
catching your eye.

The Wanderer's Room~
The windows here are shut tight, the curtains drawn closed so that hardly
any natural light falls across the room.  Red candles do little to dispel
the oppressive atmosphere of the room, their flames barely able to dispel
the shadows that almost seem to have a life of their own.  The bed has been
pushed up against the wall in a corner of the room, the floorboards where it
used to be placed a lighter shade than the rest.  In the very center of the
room, a large circle has been drawn in powder on the floor, covered with
strange mystical symbols that seem to hum and pulse with power.

The bed looks rather comfortable, but the thought of sleeping in this
room sends a shiver up your spine.

circle mystical symbols~
The circle is drawn in a strange dark powder, perfectly round and
accurate.  The symbols inside seem to have a life of their own, and you
immediately sense a great deal of power emanating from them, though it is
difficult to tell if their purpose is for good or evil.
