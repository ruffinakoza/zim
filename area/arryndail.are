The Begining of a Small Path~
A small breeze fills your body and mind with fear of the woodland
surroundings, but at the same time you are filled with peace as you take in
the beauty of this untouched and very healthy forest.  Looking around the
path seems to be the most lush path, even for the amount of traffic it gets
it stays resiliant.  Ancient memories are stored within these tree's, their
presence eminates from them.

like strangers and they have a impressive skill with a bow and some arrows.

This was a very good idea in the begining, but now you feel totally lost,
this forest is big, and you can't seem to find the way to get out of this

The Forest of Arryndail~
A mix of colors fills the Forest of Arryndail.  You look everywhere and
you notice that there are trees of many colors.  Blue, grey, yellow, many
colors indeed.  You try to understand why in here the trees have all this
colors, but you can't understand the pure, the magic mix that exists here. 
Here all the creatures live in peace, and it won't allow that a stranger
understand itself.

A Tree House~
This is a Tree House.  You look around and you see a bed, a chair, and
you notice that is something on the wall, it is a sign.  You wonder what are
the contents of the sign, you try to read it but it is in a foreign
language, an ancient language.  You forget about the sign and look around
again, better leave before the owner of this house arrives.

The Forest of Arryndail~
A mix of colors fills the Forest of Arryndail.  You look everywhere and
you notice that there are trees of many colors.  Blue, grey, yellow, many
colors indeed.  You try to understand why in here the trees have all this
colors, but you can't understand the pure, the magic mix that exists here. 
Here all the creatures live in peace, and it won't allow that a stranger
understand itself.

The Beggining of the Darker Forest of Arryndail~
You are entering into a dark sinister place.  The Colors that you saw
behind, are no longer here.  The only thing that you can see are the dark
red on the trees and the shadows moving around.  The only thing that you can
hear is the wind blowing the leafs away.  You feel scared but continue.

You look up and you can't see the sky anymore.  Those dark red trees are
now a Rock wall, a huge wall and you can't seem to know where are you.  You
can't see anything more than yourself and that wall.  But you hear a lot of
noises.  Noises of wood breaking, someone breathing and now you are really
scared.  Arryndail!  A magical place where evil lives too?!?

The Rocky Wall~
You look up and you can't see the sky anymore.  Those dark red trees are
now a Rock wall, a huge wall and you can't seem to know where are you.  You
can't see anything more than yourself and that wall.  But you hear a lot of
noises.  Noises of wood breaking, someone breathing and now you are really
scared.  Arryndail!  A magical place where evil lives too?!?

The Darker Forest of Arryndail~
You are in a dark sinister place.  The Colors that you saw behind, are no
longer here.  The only thing that you can see are the dark red on the trees
and the shadows moving around.  The only thing that you can hear is the wind
blowing the leafs away.  You feel scared but continue.

You look north and there is a larger mountainous range ahead, and to the
west you see the entrance to a cave a few paces away.  The outline of a
large humanoid creature can barely be made out, perhaps you should stay away
from the forbodeing image in the distance.

The Tomb Of an Elder~
This is a Tomb of one of three Elder Elves.  They Were the First Elves to
walk on the Earth.  They were Karaho Penkiu and Kiloste.  They were
beautiful and peaceful like almost all elves.  But one day, they started to
realise that they were a superior race and they started to make humans and
other races as slaves.  These three elves were the most powerful that ever
walked the Earth.  This Tomb belongs to Kiloste.

The Tomb Of an Elder~
This is a Tomb of one of three Elder Elves.  They Were the First Elves to
walk on the Earth.  They were Karaho Penkiu and Kiloste.  They were
beautiful and peaceful like almost all elves.  But one day, they started to
realise that they were a superior race and they started to make humans and
other races as slaves.  These three elves were the most powerful that ever
walked the Earth.  This Tomb belongs to Penkiu.

Tomb of King Arryndail himself~
This room is a very clean and neat.  Not like all the other rooms which
carry the stench of death and body parts.  This room smells of the sweetest
incense and feels safe.  There are symbols of ancient holy orders lining the
doors and the walls, ceilings and floors alike.  On the far back wall you
notice the etheral form of a Grand being sitting in an etheral throne.

tomb in the middle of the graveyard?!?  It wasn't supposed to be all broken
up?!?

This is a tomb of an elvish child.  As you proceed into the graveyard the
smell of rotten flesh, the smell of blood gets stronger.  The fog that once
was light, now is thick making you fear what is yet to come.  You feel
terrified, your eyes can't close and you almost brust into tears seeing the
age of this child that died.
