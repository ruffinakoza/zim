beetle black~
a big black beetle~
A beetle scurries across the floor.
~
This beetle is huge, almost the size of a child’s hand.  It has a thick
black shell covering its body, and runs around on crooked little legs,
scurrying about trying to find some cover.  
 
The first thing to do when encountering a new mob is to ‘consider’ 
it. When typing ‘consider (mob name)’ you will get a message that 
should give you a clue as to how difficult it will be to kill.
 
Considering a mob will also give you some vital information about 
its alignment. Depending on how it reacts to you, you will be able to 
tell if the mob is good, neutral or evil. This is especially important for 
good characters, who will receive no experience from killing good 
mobs, and will actually lose charisma if they kill too many. In 
addition to this, good players can gain a charisma point if they kill 
enough evil mobs, and both good and evil players get experience 
bonuses for killing mobs of the opposite alignment.

the ogre~
An enormous ogre is here, trying to break out of his chains.
~
His eyes are bloodshot and his face is a twisted mask of rage.  He
struggles vainly against the chains binding him to the wall, letting out
furious roars as he sees you.  Even restricted in this way, he looks like he
could do a lot of harm.

this young man nevertheless stands proud, mindful of his duty to the

herself with a regal bearing.  Her skin is wrinkled, and as black as the
darkest night.  Her hair is gray and stringy, looking to be very coarse. 
She appears to be very old, even for a dark-elf, which would make her quite
ancient.  Her eyes stare at you unblinking, two white orbs with no pupils or
irises.

the siren~
A strange woman pokes her head above the whirlpool, a calm look on her face.
~
It is difficult to make out any details, as the water is rushing so fast
and wildly that it often rushes over her, locking her down into its depths. 
She appears to be completely comfortable in the midst of all the chaos, and
from the look on her face, she almost seems to be waiting for something. 
Wild tales of deadly sirens luring sailors to their deaths are brought to
mind, and as you gaze into her emotionless eyes, you suddenly realize that
she has been holding you mesmerized, casting a spell over you as you are
slowly drawn closer and closer to the center of the whirlpool, where the
water threatens to pull you under.

A fisherman sits quietly in his boat, humming to himself as he tries to catch some fish.

Dressed in plain brown clothing, he doesn’t seem very wealthy, but he
wears a content smile on his face that shows how happy he is with his simple
life.  His boat is small but sturdy, and he seems to have made quite a few
good catches during the day.  
 
{CUsing the command 'consider' on mobs has more than one purpose.
You will be able to judge the mob's alignment by seeing how they react to you.
 
If they smile happily, it means they're good.
If they look disinterested, they're neutral.
If they grin evilly, they're well...evil.
 
Alignment is important, because you'll earn more experience for killing mobs
that are of the opposite alignment to your own.
 
Also, good aligned players will be able to '{Wrequest{C' items from good
aligned mobs. (help request).

teacher guildmaster necromancer man~
the anti-paladin teacher~
A man clad in dark, terrifying armor stands here watching you with a smirk.
~
His armor is decorated with disturbing designs, images of things best
left unsaid.  Blood has been splattered across it, and though it seems to be
in good conditions, it also seems as if no effort has ever been made to
clean the blood off.  The man inside the armor is seems to belong nowhere
else.  His face is somewhat chubby, almost sweet-looking, except for the
cold brown eyes and the cruel curve of his smile.

There are many ways for you to communicate with other players who 
are on the mud.Among these are the commands: say, tell, reply, gtell, 
whisper, gossip, newbie, and ooc. There are help files on all of these.
 
Typing ‘who’ will let you see what other players are currently online.
You may see words beside their names, such as ‘Warlock’ ‘Knights’ 
‘Shadow’, etc. These mark them as members of certain clans that 
players can join. To learn more type ‘help clans’.
 
Everything you say to other players is expected to be roleplayed, 
except for things said on ooc and the newbie channel. Meaning you 
shouldn’t stand around asking people in the room with you ‘Dude, 
did you watch the game last night?’ The ooc channel is specifically 
for those comments that have nothing to do with the game.
 
Also keep in mind that newbie, gossip, and ooc are all global
channels, meaning when you use them everyone will be able to hear 
what you say.
 
People often get these channels confused, so here’s a quick explanation 
of their purposes.
 
Newbie: Newbie is used to ask technical questions about the mud. An 
example of how this would be used could be: ‘newbie Could someone 
please tell me how to change my description?’ Questions about where 
to find a mob/item/area should always be roleplayed, not asked on the 
newbie channel.
 
Gossip: Gossip is used for public roleplaying. An example of this
would be 'gossip I'm stuck in the Underdark and I don't know my
way out, could someone come save me?’
 
Ooc: Ooc is used for anything you want to say that doesn’t belong on 
the other channels. You can discuss ideas you have, or really anything 
you want. Just keep in mind that it is still subject to mud rules.

In addition to regular ways of getting into contact with people, you can
also send them messages that they will get even when they’re offline.  There
are several types of messages that can be sent.  These are: news, changes,
notes and ideas.  Type ‘help note’ to learn how they are used.  
 
News and changes are only used by immortals to announce things that 
are happening with the mud.
 
Notes are used by everyone to send messages to each other. They can 
be sent to specific players, specific clans, specific classes, or to 
everyone at once (note to all). Every note sent should be roleplayed.
 
Ideas work the same as notes, except they are used to talk about ideas 
people have about the mud.
 
In addition to all this you can also get into contact with other players 
by visiting our forums at {Chttp://forums.legendsandlore.org{x

The Steps to the Academy~
You stand at the top of the steps to a large building made of dark grey 
marble. A plaque by the entrance bears the words 'Newsouls Academy'.
The doors stand wide open, inviting you inside.

{C*******************************************************************{x

To move forward, simply type in the direction you want to move in. In 
this case you can move to the north, so type 'north' (or just shorten it
to 'n').
 
You can see which direction you're able to move in by checking the
prompt at the bottom of the page. N E S W represent directions you can 
move in: north, south, east, west.
 
{CScanning{x the room is useful for finding exits, and seeing players and 
mobs that are nearby. You can type 'scan' by itself to see the rooms
around you, or scan (direction) to see a few rooms in that direction.
 
To turn colors on, type 'toggle color'
Typing toggle by itself will show you other options you can toggle.
 
If you have any questions related to how the mud functions, feel free
to ask them on the {MNewbie Channel{x. Simply type: newbie (message).

For example: newbie What happens to my corpse when I die?

A Hallway through the Academy~
A long hallway stretches before you, the marble floor scuffed and 
worn from the passage of countless feet across its length. The entrance 
to the academy stands to the south, while the hallway continues to the 
north.

{C*******************************************************************{x

There are certain rules that those who play here must abide by. These 
can be seen by typing '{WHELP RULES{x'. Make sure you're well acquainted
with them before you proceed, because you'll be expected to know
and obey every single one.
 
The mud also has rules about {rnames{x. Original, creative names enrich 
the roleplaying environment, so we require that everyone who makes 
a character here create their own names rather than using ones from 
books, movies, video games, or real life names like Josh or Mary. 
Ones made up of words that can be found in the dictionary, like 
Flame, or Shadowman, are also unacceptable. {WPlease make sure you 
know and understand these rules before proceeding any further, as 
you will only end up being renamed later on by an immortal if you 
choose an inappropriate name.{x

A Hallway through the Academy~
The hallway continues to the north and south, the marble floors looking
as though they have recently been polished.  Several tapestries hang along
the walls, depicting scenes ranging from quiet, tree-lined landscapes to
raging battles.  Footsteps can be heard coming from somewhere in the
distance, along with a strange clanging noise.  
 
{C********************************************************************{x
 
In order to look at the sign, type '{Clook sign{x'. Since there are more
than two things here with the same name, if you wish to look at the
second sign you'll have to type '{Clook 2.sign{x' to read what it says.
 
The look command is useful for examining your surroundings. Typing
'look' by itself will look around the room you're in, while typing
'look (target)' *Which can be any object, mob or player, or even a
word in the room description* will give you more information about
the target.
 
The way north is also blocked by a door. To open doors, just type 'open
(direction of the door). So in this case 'open north'.

A Turn in the Hallway~
The hallway takes a twist here, continuing to the east and south.  The
walls are bare, and there are no furnishings here, save for a small table
holding a vase by the corner.  A strange clinking noise can be heard from
the east, every now and then accompanied by an enraged roar.  

{C*******************************************************************{x
 
During your travels, you'll come across many different 'mobs'. Some
of them may be friendly to you, or at least let you be, while others might

The Chained Ogre~
The hallway here is filled with a terrible stench, and littered with the
remains of fish and meat that might be best left unidentified.  The source
of the roars is clear now; a large ogre has been chained to the walls,
struggling to break free.

Knowing when to run away is very important. There will be times 
when you enter fights that you just can't win, and being able to {C{RFLEE{x{x

to handle, typing 'flee' gives you a chance to escape. Be aware though
that many mobs will follow you until one of you ends up dead.

The Academy Shop~
A tiny shop is located here, making a tidy profit serving the many
students of the academy.  The selection leaves much to be desired, but there
are a few useful items lying about.  Everything is stacked on shelves behind
the counter, well out of reach of anyone with quick fingers.  

{C*****************************************************************{x
 
There are many shops scattered around the world, selling a variety of things.
 
To see what this shopkeeper has to offer, type 'list'.
To buy something she has for sale, type 'buy (item name)'
If you wish to sell her something, type 'sell (object name)'.
(shops tend to specialize in certain items, so you won't be able to sell
everything in one place)
To see how much the shopkeeper is willing to pay for your item,
type 'value (item name)'.
 
All the prices of items for sale are counted in silver. One gold converts 
to one 100 silver. There are mobs around who can trade in your silver for gold, 
giving you less weight to carry around. There are also banks where money 
can be deposited and withdrawn.
 
If you want to buy more than one of the same item, use an *. For example,
if you wanted 5 apples, you would type buy 5*apple.

A Richly Furnished Room~
This room stands out in sharp contrast to the rest of the academy,
exquisitely decorated compared to the rest of the rather drab surroundings. 
Fine rugs cover the floor, somehow kept spotless despite all the feet that
must pass this way.  Comfortable looking chairs are placed throughout the
room, offering a nice place to rest.  Large, colourful tapestries are hung
on the walls, depicting the famous deeds of students who once attended this
academy.  
 
{C***************************************************************************{x
 
The door to the room below is locked. To open it you'll need the proper key.

The Northern Exit of the Academy~
Two wide doors are set into the northern wall, leading to the village
beyond the academy.  The countless feet of adventurers before you have left
through these doors and taken their first real steps into the outside world,
a world they all intended to save (or conquer).  Though the monsters in the
academy are kept under a tight leash, used only for training the students,
the ones beyond these walls are not, and many eager students have met their
deaths by overestimating their own abilities.  
 
{C*************************************************************************{x
 
Death is a common occurance, and it will surely happen to you at some point.
 
When you die, the gods bring your spirit back to the temple in your 
hometown. For a few minutes afterward, you will be a ghost, and you'll 
have the ability to see in the dark, fly, pass through doors, and most 
importantly, go anywhere in the realms without fear of being attacked. 
This allows you a chance to retrieve the items from your corpse quickly.
 
If you attack someone, you will lose your ghost status. Otherwise you 
will remain a ghost for a few minutes.
 
If you die somewhere unfamiliar, or are for any reason unable to reach 
your corpse, your items will show up at the donation pit (or chest) close 
to where you recall.
 
A good thing to keep in mind is that you have been granted the ability
to {Crecall{x at any time while you are under level 20. Recalling will
bring you back to the temple in your hometown. Simply type 'recall'.
 
After level 10, you will see a red {RPK{x next to your name. This means
that you can now attack and be attacked by other players in your PK range.

Those with a {GGR{x next to their name are people you can group with.

The Gates of the Village~
Beginning at the large academy to the south, a narrow dirt path winds its
way towards two small village gates.  It is difficult to say what exactly is
being guarded, since the village doesn’t seem to be much more than a
collection of a few houses, along with a forge and a small shrine, but
nonetheless a guard has been stationed by the gate.

Houses line the road right up to the small western gate that leads out of
the village.  The wall here has been recently reinforced with stone found
along the edges of the caves, as if the villagers are wary of whatever lies
beyond the gates.  Beyond the gates stands a series of caves, one of which
appears to be larger than all the others.

gnome to walk about comfortably, but there is one cave in particular that
looms over them all, shrouded in darkness.  A sign has been placed before
the cave entrance, bearing a warning:

The cave is dark, with almost no light from outside filtering in.  The

sounds are the sounds of your own footfalls, and the steady drip of water
falling from the stalactites above.  The whole atmosphere of the gave is
dark and oppressive, and with every minute spent here the feeling of being
watched grows stronger and stronger.

A Torch-Lit Chamber~
The tunnel opens up into a wide torch-lit chamber, its bright light a
stark contrast to the oppressive darkness of the caves.  The chamber is
well-furnished, tables and chairs scattered around on fine rugs that cover
the cave floor, and even a bed in the far corner.  It appears as though
someone has been residing here for quite some time.  At the center of the
chamber stands a series of pools, their waters perfectly clear and still.  
 
{CThese pools lead back to the hometowns of the realm.{x Simply enter the pool
to your hometown. Example: enter old, to get to old midgaard.

The water here swirls chaotically, rushing wildly and threatening to pull
anyone under who isn’t careful.  The water moves with such force, and so
suddenly compared to the rest of the lake’s peaceful water, that it is hard
to imagine there is anything but magic causing it.  A loud roar fills the
air as the water swirls chaotically, moving counterclockwise towards a
swirling vortex at its center.

filtering through the tall trees standing high above.  The air is fresh

is a small altar by the far wall, and several bedrolls have been set for
those who need a place to heal and recover.  It seems to be dedicated to the
gods in general, rather than one particular deity, and all are welcomed to
stop here and relax.  Soft music, accompanied by the sweet voice of the
village priestess, fills the shrine with a peaceful, calm air.

distinguishing features, special clothing or armor, perhaps a little hint

someone walks in the room’, since this won’t make much sense if someone 
looks at you when you’re fast asleep, in a forest, or busy fighting, or any 
number of situations like that.
 
It’s also a bad idea to use lines that describe how others react to you, like 
‘You feel very afraid when you look at him.’ or ‘You feel at peace as he 
nods at you’. It’s better to stick to a description of their actual physical 
appearance.

them and are capable fighters that are willing to fight for what they 
believe in.

{cHalf-elves are most often born of human and elven parents, though there 
are some who are born of half-elven parents.
 
They are able to get along well with both races, but often feel out of place. 
Their human blood makes them mature more quickly than their elven 
counterparts, making life among the elves somewhat uncomfortable as they 
achieve maturity before their peers. Those living among humans develop 
more slowly than their human counterparts and can often feel left behind.
 
Half-elves tend to get along with most races, due to their more tolerant 
natures, but they still bear hatred towards orcs.{x

{WNotes on Felar Characteristics:{x
 
{DThe felar are a race of cat-like beings, standing on two legs and able to 
communicate perfectly well in Common as well as their own language.
 
They are quite tall, on average ranging from 6'0" to 8'0" feet, and 
long-limbed, granting them a great deal of dexterity.
 
Their fur ranges from midnight black to pale tan or auburn, and everything 
in between.
Amber is the most prevalent colour for eyes among the felar, though 
many possess eyes that are light or dark green, black, or shades of violet 
or gray. Very rarely some felar may have eyes of the clearest blue, though 
this is considered unusual.
 
Their hearing and instincts are keen, allowing them to see and hear 
things that those of other races might miss. They possess long and 
dexterous tails, with which they are able to defend themselves in battle{x.

A Chamber Filled with Tapestries~
Tapestries are placed all around the chamber, depicting scenes from the
day to day life of the felars.  As you look each tapestry over carefully, you
begin to get a clearer idea of what it means to be a felar.
 
{cIn ancient times, the felar were enslaved by magic-users to be their 
familiars, before they finally escaped. To this day they still suffer scars 
from that era, paying for their years of servitude which have left them 
relatively weak and dull-witted.

Though they were mistreated by mages in the past, most felar, especially 
the younger ones, are willing to look beyond past injustices and forgive 
those who wield magic. Some even go so far as to dabble in the magic arts 
themselves, though they are not particularly strong and can only perform 
the simplest spells{x.

walls, a polished floor of black tiles, and a book stand on which lies an
open book.  Upon closer inspection, it appears to be very old, being written

following chapter title:

{WNotes on Troll Characteristics:{x
 
{DTrolls are large humanoid creatures that stand taller than the average 
human, usually somewhere around 8'0" in height. 
 
They are very large and muscular and possess incredible stamina, allowing 
them to shrug off damage that would kill members of another race.
 
Trolls typically have thick, green skin, and their hair, while being any 
number of different colours, tends to be thick and coarse.
 
They possess a remarkable ability to regenerate their health quickly, their 
bodies healing wounds that would leave others maimed or even dead with 
astonishing speed.{x

{cTrolls tend to reside in dark mountain caves, or in the deepest corners of 
forests. They are primarily an evil race, delighting in slaughter and war.
 
Their large, imposing appearance tends to frighten and intimidate smaller 
races, and therefore few outside their own race will trust them far. Those 
who travel with trolls tend to take advantage of their slow intellect to try 
to control them, though they often discover trolls to be dangerous and 
unpredictable, and such a relationship almost always backfires.{x

healthy bodies and possess incredible endurance. This strength is 
accompanied by a severe lack of mental discipline and intelligence.
 
Orcs generally possess drab olive skin, with tusks jutting out of their 
foreheads, and bloodshot red eyes. Their appearance reflects their brutal 
warrior's existence, letting all who cross them know that they are made

they act.

Orcs are an evil race that delights in causing pain and terror in others. 
They will kill anything they can, and only respect those who are even

being right at the top. Their greatest enemies would be other dark-elves, as 
they all compete for supremacy within their own families, while trying to 
make sure their Houses hold power in society. It is not below a dark-elf to 
stab a rival in the back while fighting against a common cause in order to 
advance themselves.
 
The dark-elves hold an uneasy truce with the duergar, trading with them 
and teaming up to fight for common causes, but also often warring with 
them for supremacy over the Underdark. They often lead raiding parties to 
fight against nearby human and elven settlements.{x

may grow irritated with their tendency to play tricks on others.
 
Satyr females are rare, though not unheard of. When one appears, she is 
often chased and courted by every male satyr who hears of her.
 
Because of their wild and free natures, Satyrs are not judgmental towards 
other races, and tend to accept people as they are. They have no real 
enemies or allies, but rather tend to move from place to place and deal with 
people as they go.{x

The Chamber of the Rockseers~
The room is bare of any decoration, consisting only of dark, wood-paneled
walls, a polished floor of black tiles, and a book stand on which lies an
open book.  Upon closer inspection, it appears to be very old, being written
by a famous scholar long dead, Mathaeli Zra'hanan.  The writing is thin and
elegant, carefully scribed on aged paper.  At the top of the page is the
following chapter title:
 
{WNotes on Rockseer Characteristics:{x
 
{DThe rockseer are a race of subterranean elves, rarely seen above ground.
 
They tend to be the same height as other elves, though a few can grow to 
be very tall, at just under 8'0". They typically weigh between 120 to 160 
pounds, with little difference between the genders.
 
Their skin is very pale, and their hair is fine, having the look and feel of 
silk. Hair colour tends to be silver, or white with silver highlights, while 
their eyes are most commonly a pale, icy blue.

They possess the remarkable ability to meld into stone, which is learned 
once they enter young adulthood.{x

A Chamber Filled with Tapestries~
Tapestries are placed all around the chamber, depicting scenes from the
day to day life of the rockseers.  As you look each tapestry over carefully,
you begin to get a clearer idea of what it means to be a rockseer.  
 
{cRockseers are a neutral race, preferring to stay out of the affairs of others. 
They live in seclusion underground, rarely interacting with others. They 
despise the dark-elves there and avoid them like the plague, and while they 
get along better with the svirfneblin, they are still not entirely comfortable 
around them.
 
The rockseers, even according to the stories they tell amongst themselves, 
were once surface elves who fled from a great battle and hid underground. 
Through the years they have built up a great sense of shame, thinking 
themselves cowards and assuming they are hated by the surface elves, who in 
reality know little of them. They are therefore wary among elves, thinking 
they are hated, but nonetheless curious about their cousins.
 
When living underground, the rockseer live quiet, peaceful lives, tending 
their rock gardens and creating magnificent items from the precious gems 
and metals found near their homes. Most are content to spend their lives 
there, keeping only to themselves, though a few are overcome with curiosity 
and choose to travel to the surface.
 
Due to their small numbers, the rockseer are extremely loyal to each 
other, and though not violent by nature, they will fight to the death to 
defend another of their race.

{DGnomes are the smallest race found in the lands.
 
On average, they stand between 3'0"- 3'5" tall, and weigh 40-45 pounds. 
Their small size makes them vulnerable to taller races, and especially to 
being bashed.
 
Their skin tone ranges from a pale gray to a dark, woody brown. They 
generally have fair hair, and their eyes are most commonly shades of blue.
 
Gnomes tend to possess enormous noses, and, like the dwarves with their 
beards, gnomes take great pride in their size and consider them attractive.
 
Though their bodies are small, they are also wiry and quite tough. 
However, gnomes are most known and admired for their great wisdom, 
considered by many to be the wisest of all the races.{x

The Altar to Lawful Neutrality~
{WA large, open book has been placed on a tall altar.{x
 
Those who live a lawful neutral lifestyle tend to 
believe in strong, well-organized government, 
whether it is a tyranny or democracy. Organization 
and regimentation bring benefits that outweigh any 
moral questions raised by their actions.

The Altar to Lawful Evil~
{WA large, open book has been placed on a tall altar.{x
 
Those who live a lawful evil lifestyle tend to believe 
in the use of society and its laws for their own 
personal benefit. Structure and organization elevate 
those who deserve to rule as well as provide a clearly 
defined hierarchy between master and servant. Laws 
and societies are supported so long as they fit with 
personal concerns, and laws are obeyed out of a fear 
of punishment.

The Altar to Neutral Goodness~
{WA large, open book has been placed on a tall altar.{x
 
Those who live a neutral good lifestyle tend to 
believe that a balance of forces is important, but the 
concerns of laws and chaos do not moderate the 
need for good. The world is vast and contains many 
creatures striving for different goals, so a pursuit of 
good will not upset the balance. Fostering good 
may mean supporting an organized society, or 
overthrowing the existing social order. Social 
structure in and of itself has no innate value.

The Altar to True Neutrality~
{WA large, open book has been placed on a tall altar.{x
 
Those who live a true neutral lifestyle are almost 
impossible to find, as the majority of people make 
judgments. Those who believe in the true essence 
of neutrality believe that it is their duty to see that 
all of the forces in the world remain in balance. 
Alliances with such people are odd, as they tend 
to switch sides just as one side brings the other to 
the point of destruction.

The Altar to Neutral Evil~
{WA large, open book has been placed on a tall altar.{x
 
Those who live a neutral evil lifestyle tend to 
have their own advancement as their primary 
concern. Working with others or on their own, 
their only interest is getting ahead. Such people 
are known for their ‘Me, Myself, and I’ 
personalities. No scruples, no conscience.

The Altar to Chaotic Goodness~
{WA large, open book has been placed on a tall altar.{x
 
Those who live a chaotic good lifestyle tend to 
be strong individualists marked with a streak of 
kindness and benevolence. Goodness and right 
matter, but there is little use for laws and 
regulations. Their actions are morally good but may 
not be in perfect agreement with the rest of society.

The Halfling Culture Room~
Many halflings prefer to live a simple life of farming and animal herding
in their own small villages.  Those who choose to travel are at home almost
everywhere, and sometimes settle in the larger cities.  Halflings have a
great love for the good life, and will seek whatever riches they can find.  
 
They typically have light-hearted personalities, and many have found 
that when put in tough situations, halflings can show an immense amount 
of courage, though they usually aren't at the forefront of most battles.
 
Halflings have no real enemies among the other races and generally get along 
well with all of them.

The Wood-elf Desc Room~
The Wood-Elves are a little more diversified in their appearance than
their various "cousins."  While Wood-Elves still maintain angular facial
features, pointed ears, and a slim bodyframe, the Wood-Elves vary in skin
tone, eye color, and hair color, almost as diversified as humans do. 
Although not quite as diversified as humans in these ways, the hues of
Wood-Elves are much more intense than typical humans, almost as though the
Wood-Elf were a 'personification' of olive-green skin, coppery red hair, or
cerulean sky-blue eyes, or whatever tones you might have.  
 
Typical Wood-Elves stand anywhere from 5'0" to 6'0", but it's not unheard of
for them to either be shorter or taller. Like all other elves, Wood-Elves are
very long-lived, and stay looking young for practically their entire lifetimes.

The Wood-elf Culture Room~
Wood-Elves live in large communities (called tribes) in the various
forests of the world.  Despite living in the forests, though, they are a
civilzed group.  While they prefer to use that which the land provides for
armor and weapons, contact with the other races and their technologies have
taught them prudence in using unnatural weapons and armor when prudence
calls for it.  
 
As most intelligent creatures of the forest, Wood-Elves enjoy revelry, often
holding annual get-togethers for feast, drink, and dance, inviting all the
various dwellers of the forest to join the festivities.
 
Although civilized, Wood-Elves typically will not associate with other
races, specifically those not of the forest - even their "cousins," the Elves.
Typically, unless given reason otherwise, anybody that isn't a forest
creature or Wood-Elf found entering the forests is seen as a tresspasser.
While some Wood-Elves see such intrusions as a reason to become hostile,
others see openly guiding such persons out as the best way to not attract
undue attention.  Many, however, are content to just observe, simply to
ensure the good behavior of their "visitors."
