of a mountain so steep.

didn't exist or was destroyed, but there are signs that it exists!
A sign is on the side of the road.

This area is based on the Intellivison game "Advanced Dungeons and Dragons" 
which is of course based on TSR's role playing game.  The name Cloudy Mountain,
the caves in Cloudy Mountain and the mobs in Cloudy Mountain are taken 
directly from the game and credit should be given to Matel Electronics and TSR.
The city/village is from Scourge, summer 1996.  Some mob ideas are from TSR's
Monstrous Manual, copyright 1993, TSR, Inc.

You gasp as you realize that the city was not close but rather far away.  
You were mistaken by the shear size of the city walls.  The city is not very
large for a dragon, but from your perspective it is huge and the walls are
unscaleable.

Before the City of Cloudy Mountain~
In this are many dragons and half-dragons.  Under normal circumstances,
dragons tend to live in solitary environments, but due to disappearing 
territories, many have gathered in this city.  Some have also have taken 
spouses from other races, creating new half-races.  Although legally these
half-dragons are to be treated equal, most of the high ranking officials and
officers are pure dragon.

in separate sections.  By looking closer, you realize that there is tension
and prejudice among the citizens of this grand city.

they stay in such good condition with all this traffic?  The court continues

With their size and strength along with their intelligence, these soldiers are
superior to soldiers of other armies in every aspect.  With the advantage of a
winged army as well, this battalion is nearly unstoppable.

know for sure how the queen died, but it is generally thought to be foul play.
Although the marriage was widely celebrated publicly, many of the pure dragon
nobles were against the marriage.  It has been rumored that Drakknar committed
this ghastly act, but those who know him well do not believe this.

A Cavern~
You seem to have entered Cloudy Mountain itself.  The caves appear dark from
a distant but seem to light up when you enter them.  The cavern is damp and
you hear dragons snoring deep within.  Legend has it that the Crown of Kings
are guarded by two winged dragons.  High levels may adventure forth, whereas
low and middle levels should turn back.
