ZiM is copyright Zsuzsu 2004-2007

I, Zsuzsu, as owner of DnD: Legends and Lore Mud and the ZiM codebase, 
do hereby place all new work contributed to this Mud since its original 
Icey Depths into the Public Domain.

It would be nice if credit were given where due, but we the coders and
builders realize you'll probably just remove our names from the records.

We'd appreciate if you at least left 'help zim' alone.
