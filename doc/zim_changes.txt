   no reset of objects in containers
   deathrot (works?)
   scavenger mobs, if they have a lot of gold, will drop it when the pick up
   	the new gold.
   saving throws on ingested maldictions
   new item affects: regen mana/health/move, charm(lower cost), focus
   * fixed? pits go negative costs
   locate object on no-locate item gives no feedback (which indicates
   	something exists)
   fireblind after death
   vampire shows up with real name on scan?

   ranging a 'notrack' guard?
   witch-curse not aggro?

   pets nofollowed need to be pissed at their owners not who they
   	are fighting.
   add a flag for players involved in the IMM quest.
      And waffs that affect only them.
      to disallow teleportation
   ventriloquate shouldn't un-hide/un-imp upon success
   can't set ffa for under 10
   silence unsilenced noemotes?

check:
   rand ?  to see if it works in mpcodes

ToDo:
   guild hall raids
   augment - racial hatred
   percentage HP/Mana/Move
   time of day ranges for waffs
   mobs speak languages
   light repair guy
   look at item tells some details
   mwhere should work with vnums
   sayto
   "snuff" add dark flag to items?
   pets should vaporize after PK but leave EQ

   delete OLC ROOMS and MOBS!

   items on the ground, not in pits, need to deteriorate
   
   Shae's maps
   Materials
   Page player command "OOC: can I speak with you"
   osay
   collect all items of type: X
   slay all mobs of type: X (genocide)
   quest affect so you have to wait N turns to do the quest again.
   one-time quests
   "substate" "current-job" so you need to do multiple of a tast to get
   	something done "mine" "mine" "mine" success!
   when limiteds are reclaimed, keep list of the limiteds so players
   	can't go back and get them immediately.
   items restricted to race/class/size
   requested items don't repop
   iceball - range of one?
   pdata containing last 3 IP addresses

Ideas:
   traps on doors/containers.  System where player needs to
   	guess what the combo is "KFW".  Combos are random but
	preset.  Using the 'inspect' command to assess the trap.
	Needs picks and bars(?) to pick locks and traps.

      Subj: warrior spec stuff
What I wanted for the spec skills/spells was that when someone typed
skills or spells they showed up only if they were at the level for them to
show up.  So if you are to gain a skill for the axe spec at lvl 44 and you
are only lvl 42 then you wouldn't see the lvl 44 skill until you reached lvl
44.  Also in the skills/spells list the skill or spell from the spec will
show up as this: 
Level 44 Spec: Axe Tornado
 
Instead of this:
Level 44: Axe Tornado

   normal BP cost


AC:
   tohit + 1d(tohit - constant) vs. ac
   if tohit + 1d(tohit - constant) > ac, hit = true
   where you fidget the constant based on how ac's damage 
       reduction applies, as well as a generalized constant

Idea:
   You can only equip items that you've killed the mob for?
   "You see nothing special about it" (replace "it" with the short name)

Usages:
   for affects, and for items

Bounties:
   in pdata.
   see on who list, or "bounty" list.

   Shadow gets to see bounties first?
   Bonding agency takes a cut
